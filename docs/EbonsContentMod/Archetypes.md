## Collegiate Initiate (Arcanist)

Those particularly gifted in the art of sculpting spells are sometimes schooled privately in the art of traditional, esoteric, and righteous spells, in the hope that such knowledge will pave the way for the initiate's acceptance into the school proper as a collegiate arcanist.   
But many initiates find themselves overwhelmed by the extensive training and end up leaving before completing their studies. These spellcasters retain many of the techniques and philosophical bents, but are not considered to be graduates of the school. Yet they are still respected and valued, for the staff fully understand that its teachings and the scholastic, often hermetic lifestyle required to master the techniques are not to everyone's tastes. For the teachers, there are no truly failed students save those who abandon their philosophy and succumb to the lure of cruelty and evil.

## Hungry Ghost Monk (Monk)

The hungry ghost monk looks to spirits that prey upon the living as models of perfection. He sees the life energy of the universe as a resource to be manipulated, even stealing it from other creatures. It is through this constant influx of energy that the hungry ghost monk reaches his ultimate goal: power ï¿½ personal, pure, and simple.

## Eldritch Scrapper (Sorcerer)

An eldritch scrapper is usually spoiling for a fight, looking to prove that she's just as tough as a martial character. A veteran of many brawls against opponents who were suspicious of her manifesting magic, an eldritch scrapper has a thick skin and a fighting style that blends weapons with spells.
