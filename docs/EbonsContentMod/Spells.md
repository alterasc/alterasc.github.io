## Acid Maw

Your animal companion's bite attack deals an additional 1d4 points of acid damage, and the acid deals another 1d4 points of acid damage to the target on the next round. The acid continues to deal damage for 1 additional round per 4 caster levels (to a maximum of 6 total rounds at caster level 20th). This ongoing acid damage doesn't stack from multiple attacks, but the duration resets if a newer bite would cause the ongoing damage to last longer than the duration remaining from a previous one. The acid does not harm the animal companion.

## Archon's Aura

You gain a powerful aura, similar to an archon's aura of menace. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of you must succeed at a Will save to resist the effects of this aura. If the creature fails, it takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws and to Armor Class for the duration of this spell, or until it successfully hits you with an attack. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by this particular casting of archon's aura.

## Aspect of the Falcon

You take on an aspect of a falcon. Your eyes become wide and raptor-like, and you grow feathers on the sides of your head. You gain a +3 competence bonus on Perception checks, a +1 competence bonus on ranged attacks, and the critical multiplier for your bows and crossbows becomes 19–20/×3.  
This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon, such as the Improved Critical feat or a keen weapon.

Druid 1

`HalcyonAspectOfTheFalcon1`  

## Aspect of the Wolf

When you cast this spell, you take on an aspect of a wolf, including some of its physical characteristics. You become more rugged, your ears become elongated, and you sprout sharp fangs and fur.  
You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity, a +2 enhancement bonus on trip attacks, and can make a trip combat maneuver as a swift action. This trip attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Druid 5

`HalcyonAspectOfTheWolf5`  

## Barkskin

Barkskin toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at 12th level.  
The enhancement bonus provided by barkskin stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.

Druid 2

## Bestow Grace of the Champion

You channel the power of good and law into the target, temporarily giving it powers similar to those of a paladin. The target gains immunity to diseases and immunity to fear. It adds its Charisma bonus to all its saving throws. This spell has no effect if cast on a paladin. Target has to be lawful good.

`HalcyonBlessingOfTheSalamander5`  

## Burning Entanglement

This spell functions as entangle, except it sets the foliage on fire. A creature that begins its turn entangled by the spell takes 4d6 points of fire damage (a successful Reflex save halves this damage), and a creature that begins its turn in the area but is not entangled takes 2d6 points of fire damage (a successful Reflex save negates this damage). Smoke rising from the vines partially obscures visibility. Attacks made in the smoke or against anything in the smoke must contend with concealment (20% miss chance). When the spell's duration expires, the vines burn away entirely.

Druid 3

`HalcyonBurningEntangle3`  

## Call Lightning

Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 6-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell's range (measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the target point or in the path of the bolt is affected. You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed first. Each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. Each time you cast a bolt, the spell's duration is reduced by one minute.

Druid 3

`44b9694105cb4fd1a730c9e0b7105977`  
`HalcyonCallLightning3`  

## Call Lightning Storm

This spell functions like call lightning, except that each bolt deals 5d6 points of electricity damage at long range, and you may call a maximum of 15 bolts.

Druid 5

`HalcyonCallLightningStorm5`  

## Cape of Wasps

You summon a wasp swarm, which does not attack you. The dense cloud of vermin gives you partial concealment against ranged attacks. Any creature that makes a successful melee attack against you takes 2d6 points of swarm damage and poison from the wasp swarm, but is not affected by the swarm's distraction ability.

Druid 4

`b9a18fb479ce46728f9994c1b8ac6eb3`  
`HalcyonCapeOfWasps4`  

## Cave Fangs

You create a magical trap in the area that causes deadly stalactites or stalagmites to "bite" an intruder. The magical trap is triggered whenever an enemy creature moves through the affected area. The effect of cave fangs depends on whether you create stalactites or stalagmites (see below). You can place these traps anywhere within close range as free action for the duration of the spell; the trap's radius is 5 feet. Each time you place a trap, the spell's duration is reduced by 10 minutes.  
Stalactites: Shards of rock drop from above, dealing 3d8 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage (Reflex half). A creature that fails its Reflex save is pinned to the ground under stalactites and rubble, gaining the entangled condition until it can free itself with a successful DC 15 Strength check or DC 20 Mobility check.  
Stalagmites: Piercing spires of rock erupt up from the ground, dealing 3d8 points of piercing damage and knocking the creature prone (a successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage and avoids being knocked prone). Once the stalagmites appear, they function thereafter as spike stones for 1 minute per caster level and then crumble to dust.

Druid 5

## Changestaff

This spell changes an ordinary quarterstaff into a treant creature. It appears where you designate and acts according to its initiative check results. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability.

Druid 7

`HalcyonChangestaff7`  

## Creeping Doom

This spell summons to your side 4 spider swarms. The summoned swarms appear where you designate and act according to their initiative check results. They attack your opponents to the best of their ability.  
The swarms have 60 hit points each and deal 4d6 points of damage with their swarm attack plus poison and distraction. The save to resist their poison and distraction effects is equal to the save DC of this spell.  
Distraction: A creature with this ability can nauseate the creatures that it damages. Any living creature that takes damage from a creature with the distraction ability is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save negates the effect.  
Poison: Swarm — injury; Fortitude save; frequency: 1/round for 6 rounds; effect: 1d4 Dex damage; cure: 1 save.

Druid 7

`HalcyonCreepingDoom7`  

## Crusader's Edge

When you cast this spell on a melee weapon in your primary hand, you imbue it with a powerful holy energy, granting your primary weapon the bane weapon quality against evil outsiders. Furthermore, whenever you score a successful critical hit against an outsider with the evil subtype, you not only deal normal critical damage with the weapon but also nauseate the outsider for 1d3 rounds — the outsider can reduce this nauseated condition to sickened for 1 round with a successful Fortitude save.

Druid 4

`HalcyonCrusadersEdgeCast4`  

## Cure Critical Wounds

When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

## Death Ward

The subject gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against all death spells and magical death effects. The subject is immune to energy drain and any negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy. This spell does not remove negative levels that the subject has already gained and does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even if those attacks might be lethal.

Druid 5

`2d6551c685234e878c417b2f2c4782c5`  
`HalcyonDeathWardCast5`  

## Delay Poison

The subject becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the subject until the spell's duration has expired. Delay poison does not cure any damage that poison may have already done.

Druid 2

`5b66e347866349aea7397ce96584586d`  
`HalcyonDelayPoison2`

## Dominate Animal

This spell functions like dominate person, except that the spell is restricted by creature type: animal.

Druid 3

`2e665bceb9c9452ba4fbec80e0b015e3`  
`HalcyonDominateAnimal3`  

## Eaglesoul

You call forth a surge of holy power, which grants you the following benefits: a +2 sacred bonus to AC, a +4 sacred bonus to Strength, resistance 5 to acid and fire, a +5 sacred bonus on all Persuasion (when used to intimidate) checks made against evil creatures, a +2 bonus on initiative checks, and fast healing 2. Any critical threat roll made against an evil creature with a weapon you wield is automatically confirmed.  
Non-good spellcasters can cast this spell, but doing so causes them to be sickened (for spellcasters who are neither good nor evil) or staggered (for spellcasters who are evil) for the spell's duration.

Druid 6

`5642fce37e2a4db185168fb959791712`  
`HalcyonEaglesoul6`  

## Elemental Swarm

This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. When the spell is complete, 2d4 large elementals appear. Five rounds later, 1d4 huge elementals appear. Five rounds after that, one greater elemental appears. The summoned elementals appear where you designate and act according to their initiative check results. They attack your opponents to the best of their ability.

Druid 9

`HalcyonElementalSwarmBase9`  

## Entangle

This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to wrap around creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area. Creatures that fail their Reflex save gain the entangled condition. Creatures that succeed at their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again each round. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately.  
Entangled creatures can break free by making a combat maneuver check, Athletics check, or Mobility check against the DC of this spell every round.  
The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts.

Druid 1

`8babdc47898c4794803becb5f981a55c`  
`HalcyonEntangle1`  

## Explosion of Rot

You call forth a burst of decay that ravages all creatures in the area. Even non-living creatures such as constructs and undead crumble or wither in this malignant eruption of rotting energy. Creatures in the area of effect take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and are staggered for 1d4 rounds. A target that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw takes half damage and negates the staggered effect. Plant creatures are particularly susceptible to this rotting effect; a plant creature caught in the burst suffers a –2 penalty on the saving throw and takes 1 extra point of damage per die.

Druid 4

`613e9db7e6f54bf39b88ceda8fda6de1`  
`HalcyonExplosionOfRot4`  

## Faerie Fire

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by faerie fire take a –20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light.

Druid 1

`7a33251d68404c809d987dbc9030ad0a`  
`HalcyonFaerieFire1`  

## Feather Step

For the duration of this spell, the subject ignores the adverse movement effects of difficult terrain.

`c95f914085b94d68a36b708c086a1188`  
`HalcyonFeatherStep1`  

## Feather Step, Mass

`HalcyonFeatherStepMass3`  

## Fire Storm

When a fire storm spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame. All enemy creatures within the area take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Creatures that fail their Reflex save catch on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage each round after that until the flames are extinguished by making a successful Reflex save.

Druid 7

`e83f79fc89164c69bf846c2e3461860e`  
`HalcyonFireStorm7`  

## Firebelly

A magical fire warms your belly, granting you fire resistance 5 and making your gut hot to the touch (but not enough to damage you or anything else). As a standard action, you can breathe a 15-foot cone of flame that deals 1d4 points of fire damage (Reflex half, SR applies). Each time you use this breath weapon, the remaining duration of the spell is reduced by 1 minute.

Druid 1

`4f8becd222c44cb3a65661c8e8833c04`  
`HalcyonFirebelly1`  

## Flame Strike

A flame strike evokes a vertical column of divine fire. The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks.

Druid 4

`87586c503e4f47978c14d8cf90ec8dee`  
`HalcyonFlameStrike4`  

## Freedom of Movement

This spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, such as paralysis, slow, and web. All combat maneuver checks made to grapple the target automatically fail.

Druid 4

`4153fad17b784a3f9bf4f2eb9ccff719`  
`HalcyonFreedomOfMovementCast4`  

## Fungal Infestation

You coat the target in necrotic fungus that makes its flesh soft and fragile. The target takes 1d3 points of Charisma damage. Any physical attack against the target automatically adds 1d6 points of bleed damage. If the target dies while under the effect, all creatures within 15 feet of the target take 1d8 negative energy damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8) and must succeed at a Fortitude save or themselves gain the effects of the original fungal infestation spell. This is a disease effect.

Druid 3

`b4576742098440feae5c1105cd69faf6`  
`HalcyonFungalInfestationAbility3`  

## Guidance

This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance.

`HalcyonGuidance0`  

## Heal

Heal enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.  
Heal does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.  
If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm.

Druid 7

`a8c7cca7d9914915a8bdf2584aad7f80`  
`HalcyonHealCast7`  

## Hold Animal

This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects an animal instead of a humanoid.

Druid 2

`b77a3d2af5f3448291a93fdf6eb8b8a7`  
`HalcyonHoldAnimal2`  

## Holy Aura

A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.  
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike protection from evil, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.  
Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.  
Third, the abjuration protects from attempts to dominate or charm the subject.  
Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a creature warded by a holy aura, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as blindness, but against holy aura's save DC).

Druid 8

`0b724752857b47b689ef32e93b175e5c`  
`HalcyonHolyAura8`  

## Holy Smite

You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are unaffected.  
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become blinded for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect.  
The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a creature can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.

Druid 4

`dd4b92a079084c9aa0a92b9114aca261`  
`HalcyonHolySmite4`  

## Holy Word

Any non-good creature within the area of a holy word spell suffers the following ill effects:  
If the creature's HD is up to your caster level — 1, it is blinded.  
If the creature's HD is up to your caster level — 5, it is paralyzed and blinded.  
If the creature's HD is up to your caster level — 10, it is killed, paralyzed, and blinded.  
The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful Will save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all of the effects. Creatures whose Hit Dice are equal to or exceed your caster level are unaffected by holy word.

Druid 7

`2a2abce0c81048bb80536a34009f912a`  
`HalcyonHolyWord7`  

## Life Blast

When you cast this spell, you draw the life force from the surrounding land and hurl it at your enemies, dealing 1d6 points of positive energy damage per caster level (to a maximum of 12d6 at 12th level) to any undead creatures in the spell's area.

Druid 1

`0a64ccd507b8438cac40e9ebdddef4d2`  
`HalcyonLongstrider1`  

## Longstrider, Greater

This functions as longstrider, except it gives you a +20-foot enhancement bonus to your base speed.

Druid 3

`99ee01bef7cf4f73b0a5f02fad4fa041`  
`HalcyonLongstriderGreater3`

`HalcyonMagicFang1`

Druid 3

`feaccd6256aa4217981315b4dc321f66`  
`HalcyonMagicFangGreater3`  

## Natural Rhythm

Each time the creature successfully strikes an opponent with a natural attack, each consecutive hit against the same opponent deals extra damage equal to the number of previous consecutive hits you have made against that opponent this turn. This damage is multiplied on a critical hit.

Druid 2

`c4306128bef84ee2a83842c24d06b4ee`  
`HalcyonNaturalRythm2`  

## Nature's Exile

This spell curses the creature touched, making it inimical to the natural world. All animals have an initial attitude of hostile toward the target. If the target has an animal companion, it does not become hostile, but as long as the target remains cursed, their animal companion takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. The target also takes a –10 penalty on Lore (nature) skill checks as the weather and environment themselves seem to conspire to cause trouble.  
Nature's exile can be removed with break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish.

Druid 3

`e9dd6fce806440c98618ddd5534558ae`  
`HalcyonNaturesExile3`  

## Neutralize Poison

You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. If the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of each poison affecting the target. Success means that the poison is neutralized. A cured creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own.

Druid 3

`16067216289a43a18584915d01cbc41b`  
`HalcyonNeutralizePoison3`  

## Poison

Calling upon the venomous powers of natural predators, you infect the subject with a horrible poison by making a successful melee touch attack. This poison deals 1d3 Constitution damage per round for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a Fortitude save each round to negate the damage and end the affliction.

## Polar Midnight

You plunge an area into the brutal chill of the arctic night.  
All creatures in the area take 5d6 points of cold damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage per round. A successful Fortitude save each round negates the Dexterity damage but not the cold damage.

## Primal Regression

This spell sequesters the targets' ability for higher reasoning, allowing their darker impulses to come to the fore. An affected target becomes a ravening monster — savage, bloodthirsty, and brutish. Until the spell ends, the targets have all of the following benefits and drawbacks:  
The targets' Intelligence and Charisma scores drop to 1, and they are unable to cast spells.  
The targets take a –4 penalty on Will saves.  
The targets gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +2 natural armor bonus to AC, and 2d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear at the end of the spell's duration.  
When the spell ends, on the next round each affected creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or take 1d4 points of Intelligence drain and 1d4 points of Charisma damage.

## Remove Disease

Remove disease can cure all diseases from which the subject is suffering. You must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of each disease affecting the target. Success means that the disease is cured.

Druid 3

`HalcyonRemoveDisease3`  

## Remove Sickness

You quell feelings of illness and nausea in the target, giving it a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against disease, nausea, and sickened effects.  
If the subject is already under the influence of one of these effects when receiving the spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the spell.

## Restoration, Lesser

Restoration, lesser dispels any temporary magical effects reducing one of the subject's ability scores (it does not remove permanent effects such as curses or diseases) or cures 1d4 points of temporary ability damage to one of the subject's ability scores. It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the character. It does not restore permanent ability drain.

Druid 2

`HalcyonRestorationLesser2`  

## Sacred Nimbus

You are surrounded by a nimbus of golden light. Any evil creature striking you with unarmed strikes, natural weapons, or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. Spell resistance applies against this damage. You also take half damage from magical attacks with the evil descriptor. If such an attack allows a saving throw for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

Druid 5

## Shield of Dawn

Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you.

## Sickening Entanglement

This spell functions as entangle, except the plants are coated with an irritating sap that creates a painful, itching rash on creatures that touch them. Any creature that enters the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures that remain in the area must save each round. This is a poison effect.

Druid 2

`HalcyonSickeningEntanglement2`  

## Slowing Mud

You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a slow spell and also makes targets dazed for one round as they clean their eyes. A haste effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the haste right after it cleans its eyes. Slow doesn't stack with the effects of slowing mud. This spell cannot dispel haste.

Druid 4

`06b2e00844a14e3da8117e8236690aa6`  
`HalcyonSlowMud4`  

## Soothing Mud

You create an area of healing mud. The mud functions as difficult terrain. When a creature enters the mud, it is healed of 1d4 points of ability damage. A creature can be healed of ability damage this way only once per day. Also, each round after, the mud restores 1 hit point to the creature; this healing is unaffected by effects that increase a creature's healing.

Druid 3

`HalcyonSoothingMud3`  

## Spike Growth

Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance. In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.  
Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed at a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its base speed by half. This speed penalty lasts for 1 minute.

Druid 3

`HalcyonSpikeGrowth3`  

## Spike Stones

Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shape themselves into long, sharp points that blend into the background.  
Spike stones impede progress through an area and deal damage. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area moves at half speed. In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.  
Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed at a Reflex save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 1 minute.

Druid 4

`HalcyonSpikeStones4`  

## Spit Venom

You spit a stream of venom at a target using a ranged touch attack. If the venom hits, it causes blindness for 1 round. The target must also save or be poisoned by black adder venom; the DC in successive rounds of the poison is equal to the spell's DC.

In addition to taking damage, creatures that fail their Reflex saves are pushed 1d4×5 feet away from you and are knocked prone. Magical effects with fire descriptor on targets in the area of a tidal surge and similar area effects in the selected point are affected as if you had cast dispel magic.
