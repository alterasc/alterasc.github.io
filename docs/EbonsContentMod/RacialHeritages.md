## Amorphous Limbs (Ganzi)

The influence of the Maelstrom manifests in the ganzi's ability to transform her limbs into a natural weapon such as a massive clawed arm. At will, the ganzi can activate this ability as a swift action to gain two natural claw attacks that deal 1d6 damage.

`GanziAmorphousLimbs`  

## Entropic Flesh (Ganzi)

Ganzis with lineages that link strongly to chaos beasts retain some of their ancestors' immunity to transformation. In addition to gaining a +2 bonus on Mobility checks and to CMD against grapple combat maneuvers, when such ganzis are affected by a hostile transmutation effect (such as polymorphing or petrification), they can attempt a new saving throw at the start of their next turn to end the effect. They gain a +4 bonus on this second saving throw, but if they fail, the transmutation effect persists as long as it normally would.

`GanziEntropicFlesh`  

## Prehensile Tail (Ganzi)

Ganzis with lineages that are particularly influenced by the presence of proteans often have colorful feathers, scales, or skin, and a long serpentine tail. This tail can be used to carry items. While ganzis with this oddity cannot wield weapons with their tails, they can use their tails to retrieve potions and consume them as a swift action.

`GanziPrehensileTail`  

## Quibble (Ganzi)

For most ganzis, the influence of chaos is relatively subtle and manifests as an ability to infect others with entropy and unexpected bad luck. Once per day as a swift action, a ganzi can twist probability and alter the luck of a single creature within 20 feet that fails its Will save, forcing it to roll its next d20 roll twice and take the worse result as with the Ill Omen spell. For every five character levels you have, the target must roll twice on an additional d20 roll (to a maximum of five rolls at 20th level). This is a curse effect.

`GanziQuibble`  

## Racing Mind (Ganzi)

A ganzi whose lineage is linked to hunduns might inherit an aspect of the outsiders' chaotic minds. The ganzi's churning vortex of thoughts bolsters it against mental attacks, granting the ganzi a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.

`GanziRacingMind`  

## Spell-Like Ability (Ganzi)

Ganzis whose chaotic influences rise from regions other than the Maelstrom or its inhabitants often manifest an oddity that duplicates the effects of a specific spell. Such ganzis gain a spell-like ability, usable once per day at a caster level equal to the ganzi's HD.

`51e53370828142f6b0e1a0b2eac3b862`  
`GanziSLASelection`  

## Uncanny Aura (Ganzi)

Some ganzis have an unsettling aura of chaos that rattles hostile creatures that venture too close. Once per day as a standard action, such a ganzi can activate an uncanny aura; enemies within 30 feet must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ganzi's Hit Dice + the ganzi's Charisma modifier) or become frightened until the beginning of the ganzi's next turn. The aura remains for a number of rounds equal to the ganzi's Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Once a creature has been affected by an uncanny aura, whether it failed its save or not, it cannot be affected again for 24 hours.

`35eabe3c30ea42a2bdfc33499a969077`  
`GanziUncannyAuraFeature`  

## Vestigial Wings (Ganzi)

The ganzi has a pair of small, vestigial wings, likely but not limited to resembling those of a flying creature or some manner of construct. Though these appendages do not grant flight, these ganzis can use their wings to stabilize themselves when they're thrown off balance. Such ganzis gain a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws and a +2 bonus on Mobility skill checks.

`GanziVestigialWings`  

## Weapon Play (Ganzi)

Ganzis with lineages that link to the valkyries manifest their heritage in their skill in combat. Such ganzis are always proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and they can qualify for feats normally available only to fighters (such as Weapon Specialization) even if they don�t have any fighter class levels.

## City Scavenger (Goblin)

Goblins who live within the boundaries of human cities survive by scavenging for refuse and hunting stray animals. Goblins with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception, Lore (Nature), and Knowledge (World) skill checks.

`171d4a779e16445ba8dcfd7a3d6645af`  
`EbonsGoblinCityScavenger`  

## Eat Anything (Goblin)

Raised with little or no proper food, many goblins have learned to survive by eating whatever they happen across and can digest nearly anything without getting sick. Goblins with this trait gain a +4 on Lore (Nature) and a +4 racial bonus on saves versus effects that cause the nauseated or sickened conditions.

`0540867b575f4f6d878fb1fa423bc8d0`  
`EbonsGoblinEatAnything`  

## Hard Head, Big Teeth (Goblin)

`d3ccf25251074607aa706be2eeedde4d`  
`HobgoblinMagehunter`  

## Pit Boss (Hobgoblin)

Slave blood fuels the hobgoblin war machine. Pit bosses extract the last breath of labor from their charges with a liberal touch of the lash and are experts at subduing unruly subordinates. Hobgoblins with this racial trait gain a +1 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks made to disarm or trip.

`af9b3b08dd2a415f8f1b2475e11cdecd`  
`HobgoblinPitBoss`  

## Slave Hunter (Hobgoblin)

`HobgoblinUnfit`  

## Ifrit (General) (Ifrit)

Although many ifrits follow the general model of the ifrit, many more do not. Those of different lineages may evince dramatically different manifestations of their heritage, both in appearance and in ability.   
Ifrits receive a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to Wisdom, and the ability to cast Burning Hands once per day as a spell-like ability at a caster level equal to the ifrit's character level.

`IfritGeneral`  

## Lavasoul (Magma Ifrit) (Ifrit)

Like the primal fires of creation, lavasoul ifrits are both fluid and fixed, alternating between stability and violent alteration. Mutable and intense, lavasouls evoke the cycle of creation and destruction in their colorful lives, unafraid to pursue new paradigms when the old ones no longer suit them. Many are dark-skinned but riven with blazing lines, which are sometimes also reflected in bright hair or eye colors. They tend to embrace body modification, acquiring and discarding tattoos and piercings as they feel appropriate. Lavasouls can be found in places where seismic change is commonplace and destructive creation is not seen as a contradiction.   
Lavasoul ifrits receive a +2 racial bonus to Constitution and Intelligence, a -2 penalty to Dexterity, and the ability to cast Firebelly once per day as a spell-like ability at a caster level equal to the ifrit's character level.

`IfritLavasoul`  

## Sunsoul (Solar Ifrit) (Ifrit)

Strong in character and in body, sunsoul ifrits are incurably optimistic agents of positive change.   
With fire comes light, and the brightness of the sunsouls comes both from their affinity for positive energy and their own luminous attitudes. Where others despair, they labor on, striving to lead by example. Strong leaders and passionate ethos attract sunsouls, drawing them toward powerful religions or crusading nations. Sunsouls cannot easily hide their presence, and most would never try. Most sunsouls tend to have fair hair, often nearly white, and eyes that glow with a twinkle all their own.   
Some seem to glow from within, as if lit from inside by an inner sunlight. Unafraid to be seen, they dress in whatever styles please them, even when it means they stand out among populations either more daring or more conservative.   
Sunsoul ifrits receive a +2 racial bonus to Strength and Charisma, a -2 penalty to Wisdom, and the ability to cast Flare Burst once per day as a spell-like ability at a caster level equal to the ifrit's character level.

## Bullbred (Mongrel)

With twisted horns, dense muscle, and thick, black fur, these mongrels resemble bulls aesthetically, if not in temperment.

`BullBredmongrel`  

## Coldblood (Mongrel)

Despite the name and their scaly skin, coldblood mongrels are mammals, as are all members of their race.

`a2c1f69861b14575a205138eee1339e9`  
`ColdBloodmongrel`  

## Forestkin (Mongrel)

Thick leg fur and large, swept-back horns make Forestkin mongrels resemble first-world creatures of myth.

## Monkeyborn (Mongrel)

Monkeyborn mongrels are often mistaken for primitive primates when outsiders observe the thick fur that covers the majority of their bodies and limbs.

`MonkeyBornmongrel`  

## Raptorwing (Mongrel)

The expansive pure-white feathered wings of raptorwing mongrels give them a benevolent and imperious bearing even if they don't provide them with the ability to fly.

## Rockskin (Mongrel)

Encrusted with a dermal layer of rocky minerals, rockskin mongrels are often mistaken for the halfbreed children of oreads.

## Spiderheart (Mongrel)

Despite often posessing jovial and kind personalities, other mongrels tend to avoid spiderheart mongrels due to their predatory, alien appearance.

## Stagseed (Mongrel)

Resembling large, robust forest ungulates, stagseed mongrel must shed the velvet from their horns each season to make room for new growth.

## Mystic Past Life (Samsaran)

You can add spells from another spellcasting class to the spell list of your current spellcasting class. You add a number of spells equal to 1 + your spellcasting class's key ability score bonus (Wisdom for clerics, and so on). The spells must be the same type (arcane or divine) as the spellcasting class you're adding them to. For example, you could add divine power to your druid class spell list, but not to your wizard class spell list because divine power is a divine spell. These spells do not have to be spells you can cast as a 1st-level character. The number of spells granted by this ability is set at 1st level. Changes to your ability score do not change the number of spells gained.

## Shards of the Past (Samsaran)

## Bloodmarked (Werebat-kin) (Skinwalker)

Bloodmarked, like werebats, are generally communal and often defer readily to their superiors within their flocks or even other leaders or employers. They tend to be gregarious yet savage, and enjoy using their unassuming natural forms to trick others before revealing their true bestial powers. Bloodmarked reveal their human ancestry in their ability to break from the group, make their own choices, and associate with humans without trying to force their way of life upon them, although troublemakers are strongly frowned upon and find it hard to get any other werebat-kin to take their side if in opposition to the group.   
Like werebats, bloodmarked are fond of elaborate social ceremonies that strengthen group cohesion and loyalty.   
Werebat-kin ceremonies often involve wearing bat skins, sacrificing animals or humanoids, and drinking blood.   
Werebat-kin are most commonly found near dense forests and jungles. With little trust for outsiders, werebat-kin often form insular communities at the fringes of civilized societies, with each bloodmarked being loyal to every member of the community and whichever leader has bested all challengers. Like other skinwalkers, however, bloodmarked are typically born into societies that don�t include others of their kind, and these individuals are inclined to seek out surrogate flocks, generally in the form of violent gangs, tight-knit adventuring parties, or even insular academic circles, according to the individual�s disposition. Bloodmarked are generally tall and slight, with dark hair and severe features. Poor eyesight is relatively common among werebat-kin, though they often hear and smell well enough to make up for it.  
Bloodmarked skinwalkers receive a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity, a -2 penalty to Wisdom, and a +2 racial bonus to Athletics and Perception skills. When in their bestial form, they gain a +2 racial bonus to Charisma, a primary bite attack that deals 1d6 damage, and +10 foot racial bonus to movement speed.

## Coldborn (Werebear-kin) (Skinwalker)

Werebear-kin are known and respected as defenders of the wilds. They tend to carve out niches as woodland guides, rangers, and recluses to whom humans can turn for guidance in the wilderness.   
They are called coldborn because they often become torpid and withdrawn during the winter months unless they have matters to attend to, and they resume their typical demeanors with renewed energy at winter's end.   
Although they often avoid large settlements, coldborn are known to defy their ursine urges in favor of their humanlike desire for community, either forming small, intimate communities of their own (consisting of a few families or a chosen family of good friends) or arranging annual or seasonal gatherings to keep in touch with their fellows from all across the area.   
Werebear-kin are renowned for their industriousness, and often make a good living trading in skins, leather, and other products of the forest. This trade allows them to acquire useful tools for defending their homes and surviving lean times. It also means that they are often in contact with a few non-coldborn, though they regard most outsiders as greedy and obsessed with wealth and status. In northern and mountainous regions, this attitude has earned them a great deal of respect from monks. Like werebears, coldborn tend to be quite broad-shouldered, muscular, and strong-featured, but they generally do not share werebears' work-worn appearance unless they have actually known a life of hard labor.   
Coldborn skinwalkers receive a +2 racial bonus to Constitution, a -2 penalty to Charisma, and a +2 racial bonus to Athletics and Lore (Nature) skills. When in their bestial form, they gain a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom, a primary bite attack that deals 1d6 damage, and two claw attacks which deal 1d4 damage.

`SkinwalkerColdborn`  

## Fanglord (Weretiger-kin) (Skinwalker)

Weretiger-kin are known for their fickle attitudes and unpredictable behavior. Usually, a fanglord makes his living by intimidation, cutthroat business dealings, political ploys, and military ventures. Very much like weretigers, they rarely congregate with others of their kind except as mated pairs or one or two parents with a few children, although they sometimes agree to form oligarchic arrangements of mutual protection with neighboring fanglords or weretigers when each of them can respect the other's strength. They often have aristocratic connections or the charm to fake it, and are happy to settle in affluent areas, where one fanglord typically claims dominion over anything from a small neighborhood to a large city district.   
Weretiger-kin tend to be exceptionally proud of their heritage and confident to the point of hubris regarding their authority over not only humans, but also animals.   
Although usually quite capable, fanglords are not opposed to waiting for just the right moment to spring a plan or strike against an enemy, making sure they can act with overwhelming effectiveness and completely negate the chance of an opponent fighting back. As a result, they make impeccable assassins and frustrating political enemies. Weretiger-kin often have large eyes, long noses, and sharp cheekbones.  
Fanglord skinwalkers receive a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity, a -2 penalty to Wisdom, and a +2 racial bonus to Athletics and Perception skills. When in their bestial form, they gain a +2 racial bonus to Charisma, a primary bite attack that deals 1d6 damage, and a +10 foot racial bonus to movement speed.

## Nightskulk (Wererat-kin) (Skinwalker)

Wererat-kin are common in urban areas, and like wererats, they usually rely on their stealth and cunning to get by in those metropolitan centers where they are persecuted. Many rogues and scoundrels think of a trace of rodent blood as a useful advantage, and some even falsely brag of having this trait to earn a quick reputation and intimidate rivals. True nightskulks, however, know that spreading such information only invites despair, for of all the skinwalkers nightskulks are perhaps the most universally despised.   
Unlike other skinwalkers, even large nightskulk communities often draw their culture almost completely from the surrounding human society, assimilating at the cost of losing their ancient skinwalker traditions.   
Most have found that the culture of infected and natural wererats in cities suits them, and can frequently be found consorting with these full-blooded lycanthropes. Lacking the wererat's ability to hide among true rats, nightskulks often specialize in hiding instead among humans. Although they try to maintain ties with other wererat-kin and true wererats for mutual security if possible, wererat-kin have learned that it is safest to remain hidden among the human masses and disappear whenever fear of lycanthropes would threaten to make pariahs out of an isolated community. Nightskulks tend to be short and wiry, with constantly darting eyes. Males often have thin, ragged mustaches, while females have thin, birdlike builds. Both sexes like to wear fine furs and soft, voluminous garments for warmth and to show off whatever wealth they possess.  
Nightskulk skinwalkers receive a +2 racial bonus to Intelligence, a -2 penalty to Strength, and a +2 racial bonus to Lore (Nature) and Stealth skills. When in their bestial form, they gain a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity and a primary bite attack that deals 1d6 damage and can sicken opponents who fail a Fortitude save when bitten.

## Ragebred (Wereboar-kin) (Skinwalker)

Wereboar-kin are known for their fiery tempers, wide stubborn streaks, and strong familial bonds. The ragebred's tenacity and irrepressible expressiveness has also earned this race respect and a reputation as freedom fighters. Wereboar-kin are often ashamed of where their abilities come from and have no shortage of ill feelings for true wereboars, even if this hatred is mingled with martial respect. Wereboar-kin generally avoid large groups of people unless they feel confident of their own ability to buy, charm, or bully their way into power and respect. The ragebred who do live in busy social circles are those able to channel their strong emotions into far-reaching schemes, creative expression, or their professional crafts. Others choose the more common route of carving out a place where they hold power at the edge of civilization. More than one upstart liege has been a wereboar-kin who successfully created a place where he need not fear anyone's judgment.   
Wereboar-kin sometimes struggle to maintain healthy relationships of any sort because of their mercurial natures and natural defensiveness, but some find camaraderie and strength by focusing on the strong emotions they share with their fellow wereboar-kin or humans who have known hardship. They have acquired the name "ragebred" for their habit of tempestuous romances that seem to be most successful when the couple engages in frequent bouts of dramatic conflict and affectionate reconciliation.   
Ragebred skinwalkers receive a +2 racial bonus to Strength, a -2 penalty to Charisma, and a +2 racial bonus to Perception and Lore (Nature) skills. When in their bestial form, they gain a +2 racial bonus to Constitution, a primary gore attack that deals 1d6 damage, and a +10 foot racial bonus to movement speed.

## Scaleheart (Werecrocodile-kin) (Skinwalker)

Physically, scaleheart skinwalkers are thick-skinned and usually sluggish unless engaged in combat. They tend to be ruthless but patient. All are natural swimmers. In a pattern stretching all the way back to scalehearts' counterparts in Arcadia, scaleheart culture respects nothing so much as the ability to demonstrate power over others, most often physically but also through cunning and magic. Werecrocodile-kin are renowned for their surprising and violent displays of dominance they have an equally strong reputation for proving their superiority by manipulating and seducing prominent humans. Not as powerful or as solitary as true werecrocodiles, scalehearts prefer to form their own small waterside communities when they do collaborate.   
Scaleheart skinwalkers receive a +2 racial bonus to Constitution, a -2 penalty to Wisdom, and a +2 racial bonus to Lore (Nature) and Stealth skills. When in their bestial form, they gain a +2 racial bonus to Strength, a primary bite attack that deals 1d6 damage, and the Ferocity feautre, allowing the scaleheart to fight on for one more round when reduced to 0 hit points. If the scaleheart is not brought above 0 hit points by the end of their next turn, they will fall unconscious.

## Skinwalker (General) (Skinwalker)

Skinwalkers are well attuned to the natural order of things and value passion above reason. They gain +2 racial bonus to Wisdom, �2 penalty to Intelligence, and a +2 racial bonus to Lore (Nature) skill checks. While in their bestial form, they gain a +2 racial bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, along with two claw attacks that deal 1d4 damage and a +1 bonus to natural armor. Skinwalkers of specific heritages gain different ability score modifiers, as indicated.

## Witchwolf (Werewolf-kin) (Skinwalker)

Werewolf-kin are found in many areas, ranging from misty moors to dark alleys of bustling cities, and theirs is perhaps the most common visible skinwalker heritage to be found throughout the Inner Sea region and beyond.   
They often dwell with werewolves or others of their kind in small, isolated settlements that resound with howls on the night of the full moon. Many werewolves and witchwolves live in seminomadic bands as traders, mystics, adventurers, or entertainers, allowing them to wreak havoc in remote settlements before slipping off into the darkness to escape the subsequent suspicion and hostility of townsfolk. Most such bands include only werewolves or only werewolf-kin, but occasionally one group adopts a member of the other sort out of circumstance or convenience, particularly if the two share common blood.   
Werewolf-kin generally have prominent eyebrows that grow together, long index fingers, or wild hair that seems impossible to tame. Witchwolf packs are often led by witches trained in a tradition of curses and transformation tied closely to the original curse of lycanthropy; these witches are also usually the most powerful members of their packs, though exceptions exist where a witch leads with the aid of a favored ally of incredible strength. Because werewolf-kin cannot recruit ordinary humans the way werewolves can, they tend to be more cautious and maintain closer bonds with their fellows than true werewolves usually do, and their bands typically consist of only one or a few extended families or possibly longtime friends.   
When witchwolves take bestial form, their eyes typically take on an amber or pale blue hue, their canines sharpen to points, patches of fur form on their skin, and their ears elongate as their senses are drastically heightened.  
Witchwolf skinwalkers receive a +2 racial bonus to Constitution, a -2 penalty to Intelligence, and a +2 racial bonus to Perception and Lore (Nature) skills. When in their bestial form, they gain a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom, a primary bite attack that deals 1d6 damage, and a +2 racial bonus to all saving throws.

## Smoke (Fume Sylph) (Sylph)

Veiled and surreptitious, smokesoul sylphs are natural deceivers, always concealing their true intentions.   
Obfuscation, secrecy, and the shape of things not there: all these are the natural realms of smokesouls. They are experts at concealing both their bodies and motivations, and at making the insubstantial seem as real as any physical object. Smokesouls are drawn to areas of dangerous politics and intrigue, and many can be found pursuing whatever machinations amuse them.   
With few distinguishing features save ashen skin and dark hair, smokesouls can be mistaken for any number of other races. Smokesouls often change their clothing, cosmetics, or style to keep their appearance in a constant state of flux.   
Smokesoul sylphs receive a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to Constitution, and the ability to cast Expeditious Retreat once per day as a spell-like ability at a caster level equal to the sylph's character level.

## Stormsoul (Lightning Sylph) (Sylph)

With an abundance of confidence and a shortage of patience, stormsoul sylphs are personalities who cannot be ignored.   
When a stormsoul moves, either in word or in action, the world notices. Unafraid to speak their minds, they are both direct and unsubtle, and they make fierce allies. When friends are in need, stormsouls act without thinking and are always the first to leap to their aid. A stormsoul sylph has hair that always seems to move, even when there is no breeze, and acts with a sudden intensity that can seem out of control. Their eyes are the color of stormy water or lightning-lit skies, and even a casual glance from a stormsoul can seem severe.  
Stormsoul sylphs receive a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to Wisdom, and the ability to cast Shocking Grasp once per day as a spell-like ability at a caster level equal to the sylph's character level.

## Sylph (General) (Sylph)

## Mistsoul (Vapor Undine) (Undine)

Soothing and insightful, mistsoul undines move through the world with airy resilience and earnest action. With gentle spirits and contemplative minds, mistsouls are drawn to the more mystic aspects of their element. Their ephemeral, vaporous natures can allow them to lull others into a dreamlike state, or facilitate a peaceful transition into the next life. They tend to seek out places where ideological and political struggles converge. Physically, mistsouls have rounded features and graceful deliberation in their movement. They prefer soft, high-quality garments of neutral or earth tones and simple jewelry chosen for significance rather than expense.   
Mistsoul undines receive a +2 racial bonus to Constitution and Wisdom, a -2 penalty to Intelligence, and the ability to cast Blur once per day as a spell-like ability at a caster level equal to the undine's character level.

## Rimesoul (Frost Undine) (Undine)

Rimesoul undines are distant and imperious, aloof in their intellect and hesitant to change their ways. Like their ice-coated ancestors, rimesouls represent the solidification of change. They have precise, ordered minds that take well to individual pursuits. Rimesouls often choose to live in sparsely populated areas. When they do live in cities, they prefer areas of disciplined culture. In appearance, rimesouls are frequently pale, sometimes with translucent or blue-tinged skin. Rimesouls usually dress in crisp, understated fashions that present an impression of austerity.   
Rimesoul undines receive a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence, a -2 penalty to Charisma, and the ability to cast Chill Touch once per day as a spell-like ability at a caster level equal to the undine's character level.
