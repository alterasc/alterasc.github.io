## Storval's Fang

This metal +1 klar is shaped like the head of a storm roc, whose sharp feathers serve as the klar’s spikes, and it hums and crackles like a distant stormy sky. When used to make a shield bash attack, a Storval’s fang deals an additional 1d6 points of sonic damage. In addition, the wielder gains electricity resistance 10.  
If the wielder of a Storval’s Fang also wields a Storval’s Thunder and uses the Thunder and Fang feat, Storval’s Thunder deals an additional 2d6 points of electricity damage and the DCs to negate their critical hit effects increase by 5.

## Storval's Thunder

The hematite head of this +1 earth breaker crackles with electricity, dealing an additional 1d6 points of electricity and 1d6 points of sonic damage on each hit. 3 times per day, Storval's Thunder can call down a thunder clap on an enemy. If they fail a DC 20 Fortitude save, they are stunned for one round.
