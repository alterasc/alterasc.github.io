### Shadow Duplicate

Once per day as a swift action when the rogue is hit, the rogue creates a single shadow duplicate, as per mirror image. The shadow duplicate lasts for a number of rounds equal to the character’s level, or until the shadow duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell. The caster level for this ability is equal to the character’s level. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 character levels she has (max 4).

### Bleeding Attack

A rogue with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue’s sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage.  
Special: Bleeding damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess.

### Cloying Shades

When a rogue with this talent uses dimension door as a spell or spell-like ability, including the abundant step or shadow jump class feature, then all creatures adjacent to the rogue at the start and end of her teleportation are entangled by grasping shadows for 1 round (although the creatures are not anchored in place). A successful Reflex saving throw negates this effect. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue’s level + the rogue’s Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher).

### Sneaky Maneuver

Anytime a rogue with this talent attempts a melee sneak attack against an opponent that she is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against her attack, she may take a –2 penalty on the attack roll. If the attack succeeds, the rogue deals damage as normal and then instead of dealing sneak attack damage, she can attempt a dirty trick, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver check as a swift action this turn.
