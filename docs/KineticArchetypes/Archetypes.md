# Archetypes

## Esoteric Blade (Fighter)

Rare do fighters find themselfs connected to the elemental plane. For those who possess a connection not too weak to allow for channelling powers, they always choose to wield manipulated elemental energy as a preferred option over any manufactured weapon.

## Cinder Adept (Kineticist)

Among the Sun Clanâ€™s most noted champions are those who can tame the flames and bend them to their will. These kineticists are skilled riders, able to wield both weapons and fire with deadly skill.

## Kinetic Duelist (Kineticist)

In the more martial minded parts of the world, the way of the kinetic duelist is drilled into the training regimens of any potential kineticist, wanting to train them for conflict as soon as possible. Their training often emphasizes their fondness for individual combat. The art of the kinetic duelist can also be sneaky and swift, as a warrior who can carry a blade at all times without suspicion is a valuable soldier. Kinetic duelists themselves are more prone to fighting a single opponent, and abstain from larger combat whenever possible.

## Kinetic Lancer (Kineticist)

Masters of the sky, kinetic lancers have mastered the ancient art of combat practiced by the dragoons of old, blessed by the wind itself and given power to nearly fly for short periods of time. Untethered by the ground, these warriors can make impressive aerial strikes that would be impossible for their lesser kin.

## Onslaught Blaster (Kineticist)

Sometimes the tide of enemies refuses to recede, and one has no choice but to meet barrage with barrage. Onslaught blasters are an often skittish and paranoid breed of blaster, preferring widespread accuracy over a single path of destruction. Adepts at sending their blasts out in volleys, they ensure that no enemies draw too near without severe risk.
