# Archetypes

## Mindchemist (Alchemist)

While most alchemists use mutagens to boost their physical ability at the cost of mental ability, some use alchemy for the opposite purpose—to boost the power of the mind and memory. A mindchemist can reach incredible levels of mental acuity, but suffers lingering debilitating effects to his physique.

## Draconic Scholar (Arcanist)

The unique spellcasting style of dragons is the subject of many scholars. Some arcanists see the combination of natural and learned spellcasting as similar enough to their own, and decide to pair with a draconic charge to further their knowledge of the arcane.

## Drake Rider (Cavalier)

While many cavaliers dream of riding a dragon into battle, drake riders come to learn that the reality involves far more effort than they had expected. Unlike other cavaliers, drake riders must train their mounts from hatchlings, fighting and toiling alongside their drakes through countless struggles before the proud dragons are willing to accept them as riders.

## Divine Scourge (Cleric)

## Storm Druid (Druid)

While most druids focus their attention upon the rich earth and the bounty of nature that springs forth from it, the storm druid’s eyes have ever been cast to the skies and the endless expanse of blue, channeling the most raw and untamed aspects of nature.

`StormDruidArchetype`  

## Treesinger (Druid)

Elves live far longer than other common races, and a single elf may see whole empires rise and fall. Given the impermanence of the cultures around them, it’s small wonder that some elves turn to the timeless growth of nature for solace, finding allies among the great trees themselves, and even leading the forest’s plants into combat.

## Urban Druid (Druid)

While many druids keep to the wilderness, some make their way within settlements, communing with the animals and vermin who live there and speaking for the nature that runs rampant in civilization’s very cradle.

## Plant Master (Hunter)

Some hunters form a bond with plant life instead of an animal and take on those aspects instead. These hunters form potent bonds with plant creatures, and their leafy or fungal friends are more than capable of anything another hunter’s animal allies can accomplish.

## Ravener Hunter (Inquisitor)

Throughout the Mwangi Expanse, cults of Angazhan pollute the pristine jungle with demonic influence and wanton bloodshed. For generations, the catfolk of Murraseth have viewed such faiths with loathing and hatred, and they believe it is their sacred duty to hunt down the followers of the Ravener King and expel them from the Material Plane.

## Ocean's Echo (Oracle)

Although many merfolk claim deep connections to both art and the natural world, a rare few merfolk can manipulate the forces of nature and weave them into song. An ocean’s echo is a merfolk gifted with the powers of an oracle and a singing voice that evokes the legendary tales of merfolk virtuosos.

## Silver Champion (Paladin)

Paladins who serve as priests of Apsu are almost always on the move, wandering from place to place and trying to show their dedication to the Waybringer in their deeds rather than depending on mere words. More rarely a drake is so inspired by a paladin of Apsu that it chooses to assist the paladin in all her actions. These drake allies see the benefit of a silver champion remaining mobile and understand the powerful threats the champion must face, and in time even consent to serve their chosen paladins as a companion.

## Temple Champion (Paladin)

A temple champion is a powerful warrior dedicated to a good or lawful deity. She thinks of herself primarily as a servant of her deity and secondarily as an agent of her deity’s church. She has a refined understanding of a specific aspect of that faith and gives up standard paladin spellcasting in favor of a warpriest’s domain-based blessings and granted powers.

## Drake Warden (Ranger)

Some rangers specialize in dealing with rambunctious younger drakes, protecting them and teaching them to tolerate, and even trust, humanoid creatures. These drake wardens follow and pass along secret techniques for raising drakes effectively, and thanks to their methods, their drakes are both fiercely loyal and extremely useful for scouting and stealth missions.

## Clutch Thief (Rogue)

Whether to stop it falling into the wrong hands, or to hold the power for themselves, it is common for an aspiring thief to see a drake egg as a valuable score. Less common is for the egg to hatch while in the thieves care. With a bit of knowledge borrowed from the drake wardens on raising young drakes, the clutch thief gains a new and interesting partner in crime.

## Draconic Shaman (Shaman)

Shaman often have strong ties to dragon gods and imperial dragons who act as mentors. Some of these shamans draw their powers from the might of dragons, rather than from spirits. These shamans each gain a powerful drake as an ally and view caring for that drake as a sacred duty.
