## Mythical Drake

Your mythic powers unlock the latent draconic might in your drake companion, granting it new abilities based off its own Drake Power choices.  
If your drake has a greater breath weapon it gains access to the mythic variant, dealing 1d6 damage per class level. It also deals no damage to allies.   
If your drake has the draken claws ability it gains 2 natural wing attacks and the Multiattack feat.  
If your drake has the keen mind ability it gains a Charisma bonus equal to its level minus 5, along with a limited spellbook. Spells granted this way are spontaneously cast and scale using Charisma. Spells granted are dependent on which type of dragon the drake is descended from.
