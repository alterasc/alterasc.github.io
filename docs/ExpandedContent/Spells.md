## Arcane Concordance

A shimmering, blue and gold radiance surrounds you, enhancing arcane spells cast within its area. Any arcane spell cast by a creature within 10 feet of the caster gains a +1 enhancement bonus to the DC of any saving throws against the spell, and is cast as if one of either the Extend Spell or Reach spell metamagic feats have been applied to it (without increasing the spell level or Casting Time; you choose the metamagic feat when you cast arcane concordance).

## Blood Mist

This spell summons forth a misty cloud of rust-red toxic algae. Any creature within the mist is coated by it, turning the creature the same reddish color. All targets within the mist gain concealment. Any creature within the mist must save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and become enraged, attacking any creatures it detects nearby (as the “attack nearest creature” result of the confused condition). An enraged creature remains so for one minute per caster level. A creature only needs to save once each time it is within the mist (though leaving and returning requires another save).

The value of this fast healing increases by 1 at caster levels 10th, 15th, and 20th.
