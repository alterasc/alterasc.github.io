## Bestow Hope

When you heal a creature by channeling positive energy, you also relieve its fear. If a creature you heal is shaken, that condition ends. If the creature is frightened, it becomes shaken instead. If the creature is panicked, it becomes frightened instead.

## Bladed Brush

You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a glaive sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon. When wielding a glaive, you can treat it as a one-handed piercing or slashing melee weapon and as if you were not making attacks with your off-hand for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a duelist’s or swashbuckler’s precise strike).

## Channel Form

As a free action you may alter your channel energy area to one of the following options:  
- single target ray  
- 10-foot burst centered anywhere within 30 feet  
- 60-foot line  
- 30-foot cone

## Dirty Fighting

You can take advantage of a distracted foe.  
Benefit(s): When you attempt a combat maneuver check against a foe you are flanking, you can forgo the +2 bonus on your attack roll for flanking to instead have the combat maneuver not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you have a feat or ability that allows you to attempt the combat maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity, you can instead increase the bonus on your attack roll for flanking to +4 for the combat maneuver check.  
Special: This feat counts as having Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, and Improved Unarmed Strike for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of the various improved combat maneuver feats, as well as feats that require those improved combat maneuver feats as prerequisites.

## Energy Channel

You distill your channeled energy into your weapon to empower it.  
Benefit: As a swift action, you can expend one use of channel energy to grant your weapon attacks a bonus on damage rolls equal to twice the number of dice rolled for your channel energy. This additional damage is of an energy type determined by your domain or blessing: acid (Earth), cold (Water), electricity (Air), or fire (Fire). This effect lasts for 3 minutes, but each time you use this effect, reduce the remaining duration by 1 minute.

## Expanded Element

A kineticist learns to use another element or expands her understanding of her own element. She can choose any element, including her primary element. She gains one of that element's simple blast wild talents that she does not already possess, if any. She also gains all composite blast wild talents whose prerequisites she meets. She doesn't gain the defensive wild talent of the expanded element unless she later selects it with the expanded defense utility wild talent.

## Extra Wild Talent

You gain a wild talent for which you meet the prerequisites. You can select an infusion or a non-infusion wild talent, but not a blast or defense wild talent.  
Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must choose a different wild talent.

## Feral Combat Training

While using any natural weapon, you can apply the effects of feats that have Improved Unarmed Strike as a prerequisite. Special: If you are a monk, you can use natural weapons with your flurry of blows class feature.

## Flame Blade Dervish Combat

Benefit(s): When you cast flame blade, you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to your base speed as long as the spell persists, along with a +4 competence bonus on all Acrobatics checks. You add your Charisma modifier to damage rolls with your flame blade, and ignore the first 10 points of fire resistance possessed by a creature you hit with the flame blade for the purposes of determining the damage dealt by the flame blade. Against undead foes, you ignore the first 30 points of fire resistance. Immunity to fire still completely protects against damage from your flame blade.  
You may use this with Gozreh's Trident instead.

## Flensing Strike

When you successfully inflict sneak attack damage on a foe with a slashing weapon, your attack doesn’t go particularly deep, but you do carve away a significant portion of skin and flesh. If this sneak attack inflicts bleed damage, the victim of the sneak attack is sickened by the pain and has its natural armor bonus (if any) reduced by a number of points equal to the number of sneak attack dice you possess. These penalties persist as long as the bleed damage persists. Multiple strikes on the same foe do not stack the bleed damage, but the penalty to natural armor does stack, to a maximum penalty equal to the target’s normal full natural armor score.

## Improved Hunter’s Bond

When you activate hunter’s bond, you can grant your allies your full favored enemy bonus against a single target.

`MadMagicFeat`  

## Mobile Gathering

While gathering power, you can move up to half your normal speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

`2c537bf4c2854a6aa1dfcaeb3817f618`  
`MobileGatheringFeat`  

## Opportune Parry

You learn how to forgo the opportunity to strike to instead block attacks against you.  
Benefit: You parry as a free action, but need to expend one of your own potential attacks of opportunity. You cannot parry, if you are unable to do attacks of opportunity.

`OpportuneParry`  

## Preferred Spell

Choose one spell which you have the ability to cast. You can cast that spell spontaneously by sacrificing a prepared spell or spell slot of equal or higher level. You can apply any metamagic feats you possess to this spell when you cast it. This increases the minimum level of the prepared spell or spell slot you must sacrifice in order to cast it but does not affect the casting time.  
Special: You can gain this feat multiple times.Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different spell.

`PreferredSpellFeature`  

## Prodigious Two-Weapon Fighting

You may fight with a one-handed weapon in your offhand as if it were a light weapon. In addition, you may use your Strength score instead of your Dexterity score for the purpose of qualifying for Two-Weapon Fighting and any feats with Two-Weapon Fighting as a prerequisite.

`5725b7af6cd64bb8b53d6535f9de0161`  
`ProdigiousTwoWeaponFighting`  

## Purifying Channel

When you channel positive energy to heal, one creature that you exclude from your channeling takes an amount of fire damage equal to the die result you roll for healing, and is dazzled for 1 round by the light of these flames. A successful saving throw against your channel energy halves the fire damage and negates the dazzled effect.

`fe369e5a27d54c3a830ec436f29af358`  
`PurifyingChannel`  

## Sacred Summons

When using summon monster to summon creatures whose alignment subtype or subtypes exactly match your aura, you may cast the spell as a standard action instead of with a casting time of 1 round.

`974a033937494f6a80a87f98497c901a`  
`SacredSummons`  

## Spell Perfection

You are unequaled at the casting of one particular spell.  
Benefit: Pick one spell which you have the ability to cast. Whenever you cast that spell you may apply any one metamagic feat you have to that spell without affecting its level or casting time, as long as the total modified level of the spell does not use a spell slot above 9th level. In addition, if you have other feats which allow you to apply a set numerical bonus to any aspect of this spell (such as Spell Focus, Spell Penetration, Weapon Focus [ray], and so on), double the bonus granted by that feat when applied to this spell.

## Split Hex

When you use one of your hexes (not a major hex or a grand hex) that targets a single creature, you can choose another creature within 30 feet of the first target to also be targeted by the hex.

When you use one of your major hexes (not a grand hex) that targets a creature, you can choose another creature within 30 feet of the first target to also be targeted by the major hex.

`SplitMajorHex`  

## Two-Weapon Rend

Striking with both of your weapons simultaneously, you can use them to deliver devastating wounds.  
Benefit: If you hit an opponent with both your primary hand and your off-hand weapon, you deal an additional 1d10 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. You can only deal this additional damage once each round.
