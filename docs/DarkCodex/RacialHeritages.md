# Racial heritages

## Orc Atavism (Half-Orc)

Some half-orcs have much stronger orc blood than human blood. Such half-orcs count as only half-orcs and orcs (not also humans) for any effect related to race. They gain a +2 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to one ability score of their choice, and a –2 penalty to one mental ability score of their choice. They also gain razortusk. Finally, they gain the ferocity universal monster ability. This racial trait replaces the half-orc’s usual racial ability score modifiers, as well as intimidating, orc blood, and orc ferocity.
