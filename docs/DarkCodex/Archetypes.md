Combining the elemental powers of a kineticist with the rigid physical discipline of a monk, an elemental ascetic channels his powers through his body to enhance himself in combat.

## Elemental Scion (Kineticist)

There are some who, instead of focusing on the powers beyond their own, decide to concentrate on their innate talents to acquire powers far beyond a minor dabbler. All elements are equally likely to embark on such singular focus, confident in their innate gifts.

## Virtuous Bravo (Paladin)

Although no less a beacon of hope and justice than other paladins, virtuous bravos rely on their wit and grace rather than might and strong armor.
