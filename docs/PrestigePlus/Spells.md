You create a wave of thunder and force, either in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on you or in 30-foot cone-shaped burst. Creatures in the area take 3d6 points of sonic damage and are pushed away as if bull rushed. Make combat maneuver checks to each creature in the area.

## Emblem of Greed

You form a burning glaive using your magic. The weapon is appropriate to your size and has a +1 enhancement bonus and the flaming weapon special ability. When wielding the glaive, you are considered proficient with it and use your caster level as your base attack bonus (which may give you multiple attacks). The glaive’s enhancement bonus increases to +2 at caster level 15th, and +3 at caster level 19th. This spell is not cumulative with greater magic weapon or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way.

## Hermean Potential

You gift the target with the ability to perfect its actions via mental clarity. On the next attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check the target attempts, it rolls twice and takes the more favorable result. For every 5 caster levels you have, the target can roll twice on an additional attack roll, saving throw, or skill check (to a maximum of 5 rolls at 20th level).

This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

## Litany of Righteousness

Calling down a litany of anathema, you make an evil more susceptible to the attacks of good creatures. If the target is evil, it takes double damage from attacks made by creatures with a good aura (from a class feature or as a creature with the good subtype). If the target also has the evil subtype; when it is hit with attacks made by creatures with a good aura, it is also dazzled for 1d4 rounds.

## Pilfering Hand

You create and control an invisible telekinetic force, instantaneously attempting a disarm combat maneuver against a target within range. Use your caster level as your Combat Maneuver Bonus, adding your spellcasting ability score modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. This combat maneuver attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from its target, but casting this spell might.

## Rat Quadrille (3)

(Bard with Use Magic Device or Persuasion 4) This repetitive, distracting melody wears down foes. You tap out or sing a diverting tune that sticks in the mind of the target, causing the target to take a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty on concentration checks for 10 minutes. A successful Will save halves the penalties and reduces the duration to 1 minute. This ability is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.

Bard 2

`Masterpiece.UseRatQuadrille`  

## Resinous Skin

You coat your body with a resinous substance, protecting you from attacks and binding weapons that strike you. You gain DR 5/piercing, as well as a +4 circumstance bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts. Additionally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to initiate a grapple, maintain a grapple, and pin a foe. Any enemy you grapple takes a –2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape the grapple. Any weapon that strikes you becomes stuck unless its wielder succeeds at a Reflex saving throw. When it gets stuck in this way, you can attempt a free disarm combat maneuver.

## Rovagug's Fury

You create a minor earthquake that can trip creatures. Attempt combat maneuver checks against every creature in the area. This trip attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though you do provoke one for casting the spell).

## Shield Other

This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject.

## Stone Face (2)

(Bard with Persuasion 7) Your antics can soften even the hardest visage. You tell an old and humorous tale about a woman who refused to smile at anything, no matter how funny. Through a series of increasingly unlikely events involving a cart of horse manure, a king, and a flying carpet, her legendary frown broke at last. When you complete the performance, the target is affected by stone to flesh.

## Tales of Twisting Steel (3)

(Bard with Persuasion 3) This medley of tales inspires listeners to new heights of bravery and self sacrifice. This collection includes the stories of The Big Sky, The Rabbit Prince, and The Sickness, among others. When you complete the performance, choose one adjacent creature. You and that creature are affected as if you had cast shield other.

Bard 2

`Masterpiece.UseTwistingSteel`  

## Telekinetic Maneuver

You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, or trip within close range. Alternatively, you can perform a grapple (including pin). Resolve these attempts as normal, except that your CMB is equal to your caster level plus your spellcasting ability score modifier. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally.

Magus 4, Wizard 4

## The Requiem of the Fallen Priest-King (10)

(Bard with Persuasion 10) Your performance reveals ways to cheat time itself. This piece tells the story of a mighty priest-king who seemed to defy time by snatching near-victory from an overwhelming number of enemies. When you complete the performance, you gain the ability to accelerate time once, which must be used in the next 10 minutes. When you perform this masterpiece, you gain the ability to spend a swift action to restore your standard action. You must use this extra action within 10 minutes of performing the masterpiece; otherwise the benefit is lost. Your allies may benefit from this masterpiece, but they must listen to it intently (to the exclusion of all other activities) for the duration of the performance.

Bard 3

## Thunderstomp

You stomp your foot or strike your weapon against the ground or floor, creating a ripple of power that you can use to trip a creature. Attempt the combat maneuver check to trip the target, but instead of your base attack bonus you can use your caster level, and instead of your Strength modifier you can use your spellcasting ability score modifier. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

## Tooth Hunt

You assume the form of a tooth fairy. As Fey Form III, you gain the following abilities: a +8 size bonus to Dexterity, a –4 penalty to Strength, DR 2/cold iron, and fly speed (good maneuverability, better than a griffon for sure). A tooth fairy is a diminutive creature that can wield weapons, along with one bite attack (1d4).

## Triple Time (1)

(Bard with Use Magic Device 3) Your lively cadence puts a spring in the step of weary marchers. This bright and spritely tune mimics the sound of human feet, slowly building to a steady, ground-eating pace. When you complete this performance, you affect all allies in hearing range. This masterpiece increases the affected target’s base land speed by 10 feet for 10 minutes per bard level, to a maximum of 1 hour. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.

## Vex Giant

When you cast vex giant, your senses and reflexes become particularly honed against a single target within 60 feet, provided the target is at least one size category larger than you. You may select your focused foe as a free action when you cast this spell—switching your focus to a different foe within 60 feet is a move action. Although the name of the spell is vex giant, it works equally well on any foe that’s at least one size category larger than you. Against a foe you are focused on, you do not provoke its attacks of opportunity. Additionally, the first successful melee attack you make against the foe in a round deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. Finally, you gain a +4 insight bonus on all combat maneuver checks made against your focused foe.

## Virtuoso Performance

While this spell is active, you may start a second bardic performance while maintaining another. Maintaining both performances costs a total of 3 rounds of bardic performance instead of 2, for each round they are maintained.
