## Agent of the Grave

Agents of the Grave learn the deepest arcane secrets in their quest for undeath, gaining undead-like traits before their final shift to a state beyond death. Agents of the Grave master the necromantic arts, yet instead of controlling hordes of undead minions, they instead seek ultimate enlightenment, and possess subtle and murderous skills to help them attain it.

## Arcane Archer

Many who seek to perfect the use of the bow sometimes pursue the path of the arcane archer. Arcane archers are masters of ranged combat, as they possess the ability to strike at targets with unerring accuracy and can imbue their arrows with powerful spells. Arrows fired by arcane archers fly at weird and uncanny angles to strike at foes around corners, and can pass through solid objects to hit enemies that cower behind such cover. At the height of their power, arcane archers can fell even the most powerful foes with a single, deadly shot.

## Asavir

An asavir’s bond with her genie-blessed mount is even closer than the partnership most horselords share with their steeds, and her human compatriots fight with extra ferocity, knowing that they have a tireless protector. Asavirs sometimes leave their tribe to become mercenaries or adventurers, and it is from such asavirs that the techniques of this prestige class are usually spread.

## Bolt Ace

While gunslingers are full of sound and fury, there is a class of gunslingers that never soil their hands with powder or feel the sting of gun smoke. They commit their deeds in a more hushed manner, but with just as much flair.

## Chevalier

Some heroes don’t believe in fancy rules or high creeds or big flowery speeches, they just want to kill evil things, spend time with friends, and swap great tales over a good meal and tasty drinks. Not as stuffy or restrictive as a full-fledged knighthood, in their hearts chevaliers are just good people who want to celebrate the good things in life and fight evil wherever it dares to tread.

## Crimson Templar

Even the most devout followers of good can recognize the need for ruthlessness when opposing true evil. The crimson templars are taught that mercy is a virtue reserved for only those capable of accepting redemption. They must learn this lesson well, for they are trained to face the heartless legions of Hell. These women and men are Heaven’s assassins, and they tread a bloody path so the oaths of others remain untarnished. Their mission is a thankless one, as righteous allies often view them as just a step away from corruption.

## Dawnflower Anchorite

Dawnflower anchorite hope to receive enlightenment in their retreat to the wilds so that they can, some day, return to civilization and use their newfound grace to help heal the church’s wounds.

## Deadeye Devotee

Dedicated followers of Erastil become closer to their god by mastering archery and caring for each other. They can tap into the power of the Elk Father, who guides and empowers their arrows.

## Dragon Fury

The disciple of the Thrashing Dragon discipline knows the controlled fury of the dragon’s rage on the battlefield, the sinuous twists and the lashing claws of that savage beast are engraved in the body of its student. By devoting one’s self to the vicious style, the disciple learns many things on how best to emulate the dragon and its fighting style. The ferocity and grace in each twist of the blade and each leap that he makes hides a fierce power and determination to win. These specialists are known as dragon furies, and a dragon’s deep well of wrath lives within their hearts and pumps its fury to every inch of their body.

## Enchanting Courtesan

Enchanting courtesans are elite information brokers who perfect their bodies and develop their minds to use illusions, enchantments, and other magical extensions of their considerable charms.

## Esoteric Knight

Mysterious warriors and wielders of psychic powers, esoteric knights are as rare as the obscure techniques they obsessively practice. While others seek the perfection of mind and body in the pursuit of tranquility, these warriors aim to become perfect, dangerous weapons by learning occult secrets and mastering deadly fighting moves. Esoteric knights know that balance between mind and body is an advantage they can exploit against those who favor brains or brawn.

## Evangelist

Though all faiths have their dedicated priests and righteous warriors, gods inspire devotion from a wide range of individuals. Rogues who specialize in stealth and poisons might swear allegiance to Norgorber, while wandering bards sing songs in praise of Desna. Even the most powerful deity is not too proud to turn such followers aside, for the worship of passionate acolytes is precious regardless of their backgrounds, professions, races, or ages, and they might lead others to the faith by example. These unusual but skillful followers of the gods are called evangelists.

## Forest Warden

Forest warden is a title that few can reasonably hope to earn. Among the freedom fighters, wardens have proven themselves again and again, taking on enemies that threaten the fate of the land. With their unmatched martial prowess and tactical skills, forest wardens are masters of the forest. They specialize in neutralizing enemies without being seen, but they are not a threat to be taken lightly even in close-quarters combat.

## Furious Guardian

After centuries of raiding and pillaging throughout Avistan, the Ulfen have earned their reputation for ferocity and fearlessness. Though seemingly at odds with this perception of barbarism, Ulfen are also known for their staunch loyalty, strong sense of honor, and unyielding resolve. The combination of these reputations is in large part why they have become desired as bodyguards throughout the region.

## Golden Legionnaire

Above all else, the Golden Legion’s duty is domestic security; the Legion extensively trains its soldiers in defensive tactics and strategies that ensure the protection of both Andorens and other members of the Legion. That said, a typical Golden Legionnaire exhibits audacious courage and unflinchingly puts himself between those he protects and possible threats. An ambush or unprovoked attack incenses a Golden Legionnaire and propels him to acts of selfless bravery and daring prowess. Even when they are hundreds of miles away from their homes, Golden Legionnaires use their skills and combat prowess to protect their allies and Andoran’s ideals of equality, freedom, and justice.

## Halfling Opportunist

Even more so than the rest of their kind, halfling opportunists make their own luck. Shamelessly willing to take advantage of their foes, they can instantly assess a situation in order to find a way to turn it to their own benefit. When a giant swings his club, the halfling opportunist leaps onto it and uses the momentum to make her jump go that much further. When a spellcaster hurls a bolt of magical energy, the halfling opportunist steps in front of a door and uses the power to help her to smash through so she can make her escape. When a courtier tries to blacken her name, the halfling opportunist lets loose such a stream of cheeky accusations that the courtier ends up looking like the traitor instead. Halfling opportunists’ ability to exploit their enemies gives them a breezy self-confidence and the sheer audacity to take risks few others would dare. Perhaps because of this brazenness, they seem blessed by amazing strokes of good fortune. However, they rarely take their luck for granted. Instead they rely upon their keen senses to sidestep danger and their adaptability to carry them through both combat and social settings.

## Heritor Knight

Some seek to follow in the footsteps of Iomedae the Inheritor through study of the miracles of her mortal life.

## Hinterlander

Hinterlanders shield rural folk from dangerous creatures, extraplanar interlopers, and marauding undead. A hinterlander is skilled with a bow and in tune with the wild, yet capable of harnessing natural resources to nourish mortal communities. They are often touched by the divine, sworn to guard the borders of towns and villages against the forces that threaten to snuff out the hearth fires.

## Horizon Walker

Those whose wanderlust drives them to push the boundary of safe environments sometimes seek the calling of the horizon walker. Horizon walkers are masters of travel, always seeking to find the safe ways through inhospitable terrain. They are comfortable in places others speak of only in hushed whispers, and they can both venture forth onto untrod paths themselves and guide the less-traveled through such hazardous lands.

## Inheritor’s Crusader

Honor, justice, and valor—while many righteous folk believe in these things, a select group of champions live and breathe them. It is in their blood and constantly at the forefront of their thoughts. The teachings of this once small, exclusive group of knights have inspired others, and now heroes all across the world take up swords in the name of these ideals. Most crusaders spend their time advancing the cause of the downtrodden, freeing the oppressed from tyranny and injustice, or helping the timid rise up in the face of evil, though their powers also make them suited for hunting down criminals, breaking the mental shackles of brainwashing and witchcraft, and destroying monsters that pierce the bravest hearts with fear.

## Lion Blade

Lion blades come from the most secretive schools of the fighting arts. They scoff at assassins, laughing at their poisons and blow guns — and they’re equally derisive of knights, stomping about the battlefield in burdensome armor and wielding huge, slow weapons. Lion blades prefer crowded urban areas and are masters of motion, controlling both their own movement and those around them, and then step into a crowd and disappear from sight. They are quick, agile, knowledgeable, and masters of disguise.

## Mammoth Rider

From the inhospitable arctic wastes of the far north come the mighty mammoth riders, fearsome warriors who have trained the great beasts that wander the chilly wilds to serve as their faithful steeds. Toughened by their harsh environment, mammoth riders tame their surroundings through tenacious determination and sheer force of will, fighting alongside their bestial companions to take down huge game and carve out a hard existence in the icy north.

## Mortal Usher

Whether the trouble is a formidable lich draining power from thousands of enslaved ghosts or a qlippoth funneling stolen souls through an Abyssal stronghold, occasionally the psychopomps must enlist a mortal usher—a living agent imbued with their power and cunning—to travel where even the guardians of the River of Souls cannot tread.

## Sanguine Angel

Sanguine angels are heartless soldiers who have turned to worship infernal demigoddesses. These vengeful devils reward the company’s elite with infernal powers.

## Scar Seeker

Some turn their own skins into scarred manuscripts of noteworthy deeds and unforgettable failures. Those who wholly embrace these rites of scarification are known as scar seekers.

## Sentinel

Every major deity boasts champions of some type, whether they are paladins sworn to The Inheritor or barbarians who channel their destructive rage from The Rough Beast. The sentinel is a warrior who receives special powers in exchange for his service to a deity, and often serves as a guard for the deity’s clergy. Some undergo official training, others experience visions leading them to their path, and some simply make the decision to pledge their lives to upholding their faith.

## Shadowdancer

Shadowdancers exist in the boundary between light and darkness, where they weave together the shadows to become half-seen artists of deception. Unbound by any specified morality or traditional code, shadowdancers encompass a wide variety of adventuring types who have seen the value of the dark. Spellcasters use their abilities to safely cast spells from hiding and then move quickly away, while classes devoted to hand-to-hand combat enjoy the ability to attack foes with the element of surprise. Some even take the name of their kind quite literally, becoming eerie and mysterious performers and dancers, though more often the temptation presented by their talents with deception and infiltration causes shadowdancers to turn to lives of thievery.

## Souldrinker

Pledging their souls to the Horsemen, souldrinkers learn the worst of daemonic magic while gaining the ability to bind and devour souls. With every soul they consume, these casters tithe a fraction to their patrons in Abaddon. They are the proxies of death, serving the architects of the apocalypse until eventually their own souls are drawn into their masters’ waiting maws.

## Umbral Agent

Some Umbral agents work in the open as diplomats and consuls, others in secret as spies, agitators, and agents provocateur. Most agents spend their time hunting down apostates and heretics, seeking to purge the world of inappropriate influences. Those acting abroad seek out positions in rival nations’ halls of power. Regardless of their methods, all serve the will of their dark god with blind devotion.
