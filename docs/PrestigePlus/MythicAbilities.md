In a round, you can trip a number of creatures equal to 1 + half your tier in this way.

You tie knots in rope with a flick of your wrist, and can do so from the far end of the rope. As a full round action, you can make a range touch attack with it, then attempt a grapple combat maneuver against that creature you hit, adding your tier to your combat maneuver check. If successful, you are not considered to be grappled, though you still can't move.

If you’re grappling a creature and are attacked with a melee or ranged attack, once per round you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against your grappled opponent.

Your sunder combat maneuver no longer disables armor, but rends it. If the check is successful, deal your weapon damage to the target and reduce the target’s armor bonus, natural armor bonus, or shield bonus by half your tier (minimum 1). If the creature has an enhancement bonus to the bonus you chose, reduce the normal bonus first, then apply any leftover reduction to the enhancement bonus. You can’t reduce the bonus below 0.
