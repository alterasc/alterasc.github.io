## Arm Bind

You can attempt a combat maneuver check to disarm a foe even if the foe uses natural weapons. This functions as the disarm combat maneuver.

## Bardic Masterpieces

Talented bards can learn or create masterpieces, unusual applications of the bardic performance ability requiring special training. Each masterpiece has an associated cost to learn it. Typically, a bard must spend one of his bard spells known of a specific spell level or select it in place of a feat. The bard can spend a bard spell known of a level higher than the listed level to learn a masterpiece.

## Binding Throw

You can strike your enemy and use the blow as an opportunity to grab and hold him. Before you use the Ki Throw feat on an opponent, you can use a swift action to attempt a grapple combat maneuver against that opponent. A monk may take this as a bonus feat at 10th level.

## Black Seraph Annihilation

You drive your foes before you. Creatures within 30 feet of you can be affected by fear effects even if they are normally immune to fear. Creatures within 30 feet of you that are normally immune to mind-affecting effects can still be affected by demoralize actions, although they gain a +5 resistance bonus if saves are required.

## Charging Stag Style

This style originated among shamanic monks who spent their lives in the wild, allowing them to quickly subdue both game and poachers using the element of surprise. Practitioners of Charging Stag Style can charge fluidly around trees, taking enemies by surprise in the wilderness. When using this style and not mounted, you can charge through difficult terrain, allies and obstacles, making turns if neccessary. You must see your target at the beginning of your charge, and can make only a single attack at the end, even if you would normally be able to make multiple attacks (such as with the pounce ability).

## Cloak and Dagger Style

Your attacks effortlessly inflict debilitating conditions on unaware opponents. Choose one light melee weapon.

`0e788797b9d444b5a8b2c1dec6332e8c`  
`CloakDaggerStyle`  

## Cloak and Dagger Subterfuge

Your increased martial skill allows you to take advantage of distracted foes to easily impose conditions, and even steal items without being noticed. While you are using Cloak and Dagger Style and wielding your chosen weapon, whenever you make an attack of opportunity against a target, you can attempt a free dirty trick combat maneuver check against the target as a free action as well. Additionally, whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick maneuver against a target, you can immediately attempt a disarm combat maneuver check against the target as a free action.

`45245fb848064a24bd3355f12c6be69c`  
`CloakDaggerSubterfuge`  

## Cloak and Dagger Tactics

You devastate enemies that you catch off-guard. While you are using Cloak and Dagger Style and wielding your chosen weapon, whenever you hit an opponent that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC or that you are flanking, or make an attack using Vital Strike (or its improved or greater versions), you can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check against that opponent as a free action. If you succeed, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or gain the confused condition, if immune, gain the staggered condition, if immune, gain the exhausted condition, if immune, anchored in place and unable to move. This additional penalty lasts only 1 round, regardless of how long the dirty trick’s normal penalty lasts. You can only attempt one free dirty trick combat maneuver check per round using this feat.

`WeaponTrickCrushArmor`  

## Deadly Agility

You may add your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier when wielding a light weapon or a weapon that gains the benefits of the Weapon Finesse feat (such as the rapier) when determining additional damage inflicted upon a successful attack. When wielding a weapon in your off-hand, Deadly Agility will add the same fraction of Dexterity as you normally would for Strength.

`95278bf267f545bc8e5393208b27c2e4`  
`PoWDeadlyAgility`  

## Deific Obedience

Your reverence for a deity is so great that daily prayer and minor sacrifices grant you special boons. Each deity requires a different daily obedience, but all obediences take no more than 1 hour per day to perform. Once you’ve performed the obedience, you gain the benefit of a special ability or resistance as indicated in the Obedience entry for the god to whom you performed the obedience. If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your deity upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed, a boon’s effects are constant.

`DeificObedience.DeificObedience`  

## Dirty Fighting

You can take advantage of a distracted foe. You can increase the bonus on your attack roll for flanking to +4 for combat maneuver checks. This feat counts as having Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, and Improved Unarmed Strike for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of the various improved combat maneuver feats, as well as feats that require those improved combat maneuver feats as prerequisites.

`ba31f32db546474b884fa5c61e0b80af`  
`Feat.DirtyFighting`  

## Dirty Trick Master

You are adept at stifling your enemies and can expertly make a bad situation even worse. Whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against an opponent who is still affected by a condition inflicted by a previous dirty trick (whether your own or another creature’s), you can cause the condition to worsen. In addition to increasing the duration of the condition as normal, you cause an opponent who is entangled to become staggered, and sickened to become nauseated. This worsened condition replaces the previous dirty trick condition, and lasts for the duration of the dirty trick.

`031ea33b689c4200a1603f375d220fee`  
`DirtyTrickMaster`  

## Diverse Obedience

Your intense faith in your deity allows you to gain boons not granted to most followers. You are treated as though you had 2 more Hit Dice than you actually do for the purposes of determining what divine boons you gain as a result of performing your deity’s obedience. Diverse Obedience doesn’t allow access to divine boons granted through prestige classes early, as those boons are tied to prestige class levels gained, not overall Hit Dice. Additionally, whenever you would gain a boon, you can choose among the options available for exalted or sentinel boons.

`49da599ef9c54f208009b5f640980f7d`  
`DiverseObediencePro`  

## Divine Defiance

You distrust, disrespect, or doubt the gods, which helps you fight off their power. You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against divine casters and mythic creatures.

`5e3685a7aaba45cf9567547fabd12e4b`

`201c54a4f2d243baa4aa7a9f53745896`  
`DramaticSlam`  

## Eldritch Assault

You make deadly strikes when magic cloaks your location. Whenever you attack from total concealment provided by a magical source (such as the displacement or invisibility spells), the first attack roll you make each round that is a critical threat is automatically confirmed as a critical hit.

`483594772f4348e491a4c8d3c22a3329`  
`Feat.EldritchAssaultFeat3`  

## Enhanced Ki Throw

You enhance the force of your ki throws, enabling you to devastate your opponents as you slam them to the ground. Before using the Ki Throw feat, you can expend 1 ki point to amplify the force of your attack. If your ki throw succeeds, when the target hits the ground, it takes damage as if you had hit it with an unarmed strike.

`c5a057e2caa14ad59c63b4bbd57ccc49`  
`EnhancedThrow`  

## Follow-Up Strike

You bat away an opponent’s weapon, creating an opening for a punch or kick. Whenever you succeed at a combat maneuver check to disarm an opponent, you can spend a swift action to make an unarmed strike attack at your highest base attack bonus against the target you disarmed.

`2fd62420e37e426389155bcb84597083`  
`FollowUpStrike`  

## Grabbing Drag

You can use a move action to attempt a grapple combat maneuver against a creature within 30 feet to pull it towards you. This movement as well as the ability itself provoke attack of opportunity.

`ImprovedGrapple`  

## Greater Grapple

Maintaining a grapple is second nature to you. You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to grapple a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Grapple. Once you have grappled a creature, maintaining the grapple is a move action. This feat allows you to make a second grapple check as a standard action each round to move, harm, or pin your opponent further.

`cb3b76660ad14add8157bac7e2a15d5a`  
`GreaterGrapple`

`Feat.GuidedHand`  

## Hamatula Strike

You can catch your opponents on your weapon and hold them in place. Whenever you damage an opponent with a melee piercing weapon, you can immediately make a grapple check; success means the opponent is impaled on your weapon and you both gain the grappled condition. While the opponent is impaled, as an attack action you may make a grapple check on your turn at a -4 penalty to damage the opponent with your weapon, even if your weapon cannot normally be used in a grapple.

`3db2b5602f6645f5894214b826055f7c`  
`HamatulaStrike`

`DivineDefianceIconoclast`  

## Improved Ki Throw

Your enemies are living weapons in your hands. When using the Ki Throw feat, you may throw your target into any square you threaten that is occupied by another creature. Make a bull rush combat maneuver check with a –4 penalty against the secondary target. If this check succeeds, the thrown creature lands prone in the secondary target’s square, while the secondary target is pushed back and knocked prone in an adjacent square. If the check fails, the thrown creature lands prone in the nearest square you threaten adjacent to the secondary target. A monk may take this as a bonus feat at 10th level.

`ededdd8119134e5796a2b07694dadcfa`  
`ImprovedKiThrow`  

## Improved Parry

A flick of the wrist binds your opponent’s weapon. When you successfully parry a foe’s melee attack, your next melee attack against the target does not allow the enemy to apply its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). This attack must be made before the end of your next turn.

## Jabbing Master

Your quick punches become even more lethal. While using Jabbing Style, the extra damage you deal when you hit a single target with two unarmed strikes increases to 2d6, and the extra damage when you hit a single target with three or more unarmed strikes increases to 4d6.

`df43d731b3c942948ab90369cb9a4851`  
`JabbingMaster`  

## Jabbing Style

A cluster of quick strikes deals more damage than a single roundhouse swing. When you hit a target with an unarmed strike and you have hit that target with an unarmed strike previously that round, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage to that target.

`1e5ec86c6ee44843945ff733d8a2539a`  
`JabbingStyle`  

## Ki Throw

Your physical control and mastery of momentum allows you to throw enemies. On a successful unarmed trip attack against a target, before moving elsewhere you may throw the target prone in any square you threaten rather than its own square. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you cannot throw the creature into a space occupied by other creatures. A monk may gain Ki Throw as a bonus feat at 10th level.

In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to maintain a grapple.

`6271c0e45ac2436cbaae0c88d7aba115`

You squeeze your opponent tightly enough to crush armor between you. The damage you deal with the Kraken Style feat on a successful grapple combat maneuver check increases to an amount equal to your Wisdom modifier + 4 force damage. While using this style, you can crush your opponent when you successfully maintain a grapple instead of choking, damaging, moving, pinning, or tying up your opponent. When you do, the target loses its bonuses from armor for 1 round.

## Ladder Lock

`RippleWaterPro`  

## Savage Slam

Using your lock on the enemy’s body, you forcefully hurl your opponent to the ground.
