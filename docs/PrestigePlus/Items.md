## Emblem of Greed

You form a burning glaive using your magic. The weapon is appropriate to your size and has a +1 enhancement bonus and the flaming weapon special ability. When wielding the glaive, you are considered proficient with it and use your caster level as your base attack bonus (which may give you multiple attacks). The glaive’s enhancement bonus increases to +2 at caster level 15th, and +3 at caster level 19th. This spell is not cumulative with greater magic weapon or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way.
