### Ki Leech

You place your spirit in a receptive state so when you confirm a critical hit against a living enemy or reduce a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can steal some of that creature’s ki. This replenishes 1 point of ki as long as you have at least 1 ki point in your ki pool. This does not allow you to exceed your ki pool’s maximum. This ability does not stack with similar abilities (such as the steal ki ability of the hungry ghost monk). This spell has no effect if you do not have a ki pool.

A qualifying opponent has a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than your Hit Dice –4.

### Ki Power: One Touch

As long as he has at least 1 point remaining in his ki pool, as a standard action, a monk with this power can make an unarmed strike against a foe as a touch attack. He adds 1/2 his monk level as a bonus on the damage roll. He can spend 1 ki point to double this bonus for that attack.
