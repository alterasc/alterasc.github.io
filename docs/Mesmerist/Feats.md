## Demoralizing Stare

When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will Save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become shaken for 1 round. This can’t cause the target to become frightened, even if the target is already shaken.

## Fatiguing Stare

When a target takes damage from your painful stare, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become fatigued for 1 round. This can’t cause the target to become exhausted, even if the target is already fatigued.
