# Rogue Talents

## Bleeding Attack

A rogue with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogueâ€™s sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleed damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess.

## Graceful Athlete

Add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength bonus to Athletics checks. This feat grants no benefit to creatures that already add their Dexterity modifier to Athletics checks (such as all Tiny or smaller creatures).
