## Accursed Glare

You channel a fell curse through your glare. If the target fails its saving throw, it begins to obsessively second guess its actions and attract bad luck. Whenever the target attempts an attack roll or saving throw while the curse lasts, it must roll twice and take the lower result.

## Age Resistance

You ignore the physical detriments of being middle-aged or old-aged. This spell does not cause you to look younger, nor does it prevent you from dying of old age, but as long as the spell is in effect, you ignore the –3 penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution that accrue once you become old-aged. You retain the age-related bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while under the effects of this spell. Additional penalties that you accrue upon becoming venerable apply in full.

## Age Resistance, Greater

You ignore the physical detriments of age. This spell does not cause you to look younger, nor does it prevent you from dying of old age, but as long as the spell is in effect, you ignore the –6 penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution that accrue once you become venerable. You retain the age-related bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while under the effects of this spell.

You ignore the physical detriments of being middle-aged. This spell does not cause you to look younger, nor does it prevent you from dying of old age, but as long as the spell is in effect, you ignore the –1 penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution that accrue once you become middle-aged. You retain the age-related bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while under the effects of this spell. Additional penalties that you accrue upon becoming old or venerable apply in full.

## Cloak Of Winds

You shroud a creature in a whirling screen of strong, howling wind. Ranged attack rolls against the subject take a -4 penalty.

## Greater Stunning Barrier

You are closely surrounded by a barely visible magical field. The field provides a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack is stunned for 1 round (Will negates). Once the field has stunned a number of creatures equal to your caster level, the spell is discharged.

## Inflict Pain

You telepathically wrack the target’s mind and body with agonizing pain that imposes a –4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. A successful Will save reduces the duration to 1 round.

## Mage's Disjunction

All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are unraveled and destroyed completely (ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item for the duration of this spell. An item in a creature’s possession uses its possessor’s Will save bonus.

## Sands Of Time

You temporarily age the target, immediately advancing it to the next age category. The target immediately takes the age penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for its new age category, but does not gain the bonuses for that category. A creature whose age is unknown is treated as if the spell advances it to middle age. If you cast this on an object, construct, or undead creature, it takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level(maximum + 15) as time weathers and corrodes it instead.  
  
Middle Age: -1 to all physical stats +1 to all mental stats.  
Old Age: -3 to all physical stats +2 to all mental stats.  
Venerated Age: -6 to all physical stats +3 to all mental stats.

## Shadow Enchantment

You use material from the Shadow Plane to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a psychic, sorcerer, or wizard enchantment spell of 2nd level or lower. Spells that deal damage or have other effects work as normal unless the affected creature succeeds at a Will save. If the disbelieved enchantment spell has a damaging effect, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur.  
If recognized as a shadow enchantment, a damaging spell deals only one - fifth(20 %) the normal amount of damage.  
If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow enchantment’s level (3rd) rather than the spell’s normal level. Objects, mindless creatures, and creatures immune to mind-affecting effects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell.

## Shadow Enchantment, Greater

This spell functions like shadow enchantment, except that it enables you to create partially real, illusory versions of psychic, sorcerer, or wizard enchantment spells of 5th level or lower. If the spell is recognized as a greater shadow enchantment, it’s only three-fifths (60%) as effective.

## Spellcurse

You disrupt any spell energy affecting your target, causing that energy to crackle with power and harm the target. The target takes 1d6 points of damage for each spell with a duration of 1 round or greater currently affecting it. The spells themselves are not dispelled or modified.

## Web Bolt

You launch a ball of webbing at a target, which must make a save or be affected as if by a web spell occupying only the creature’s space.  
  
Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spiderwebs but far larger and tougher. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers.  
Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check, Athletics check, or Mobility check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the webs must make a Reflex save each round. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of webbing that they enter.
