## Accursed Hex

When you target a creature with a hex that cannot target the same creature more than once per day, and that creature succeeds at its saving throw against the hex’s effect, you can target the creature with the same hex a second time before the end of your next turn. If the second attempt fails, you can make no further attempts to target that creature with the same hex for 1 day.

`AnimalAllyFeatureSelection`  

## Arcane Discovery

Wizards spend much of their lives seeking deeper truths, hunting knowledge as if it were life itself. The wizard’s power is not necessarily the spells he wields; spells are merely the outward, most visible manifestation of that power. A wizard’s true power is in his fierce intelligence, his dedication to his craft, and his ability to peel back the surface truths of reality to understand the fundamental underpinnings of existence. A wizard spends much of his time researching spells, and would rather find an undiscovered library than a room full of gold. A wizard need not be a reclusive bookworm, but he must have a burning curiosity for the unknown. Arcane discoveries are the results of this obsession with magic.  
A wizard can learn an arcane discovery in place of a regular feat or wizard bonus feat.

## Armor Mastery

Armor mastery feats are a new type of feat that require armor training as a prerequisite. They count as combat feats for all purposes, including which classes can select them as bonus feats. You gain the benefits of an armor mastery feat only while wearing armor with which you are proficient and only while wearing a type of armor that matches the feat’s armor proficiency feat prerequisite, if any. Armor mastery feats without armor proficiency prerequisites can be used while wearing any suit of armor. Characters who lack the armor training class feature can access armor mastery feats by taking a relevent Armor Focus feat.

`ArmorMasterySelection`  

## Celestial Servant

Your animal companion, familiar, or mount gains the celestial template and becomes a magical beast, though you may still treat it as an animal when using Handle Animal, wild empathy, or any other spells or class abilities that specifically affect animals.  
Creature gains spell resistance equal to its level + 5. It also gains:  
1 — 4 HD: resistance 5 to cold, acid, and electricity.  
5 — 10 HD: resistance 10 to cold, acid, and electricity, DR 5/evil  
11+ HD: resistance 15 to cold, acid, and electricity, DR 10/evil  
Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, the celestial creature may smite a evil-aligned creature. As a swift action, the creature chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, the creature adds its Charisma bonus (if any) to attack rolls and gains a damage bonus equal to its HD against that foe. This effect persists until the target is dead or the creature rests.

`CelestialServant`  

## Chain Challenge

You feed off the rush of victory over your enemies, and channel that fervor into battle.  
Benefit(s): When the target of your challenge ability is killed or knocked unconscious, you can declare a new challenge on the nearest target within 30 feet as a free action.  
If you declare a new challenge using this feat, it doesn’t count against your total daily uses of challenge. You can chain together a number of challenges beyond the first equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1).

## Dervish Dance

When wielding a scimitar with one hand, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on melee attack and damage rolls. You treat the scimitar as a one-handed piercing weapon for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a duelist’s precise strike ability). The scimitar must be for a creature of your size. You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a weapon or shield (other than a buckler) in your off hand.

## Greater Spell Specialization

By sacrificing a prepared spell of the same or higher level than your specialized spell, you may spontaneously cast your specialized spell. The specialized spell is treated as its normal level, regardless of the spell slot used to cast it.

`LungingSpellTouchFeature`

`MantisTormentFeature`
