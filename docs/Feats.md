`FlameBladeDervishCombat`  

### Flensing Strike

When you successfully inflict sneak attack damage on a foe with a slashing weapon, your attack doesn’t go particularly deep, but you do carve away a significant portion of skin and flesh.

These penalties persist as long as the bleed damage persists. Multiple strikes on the same foe do not stack the bleed damage, but the penalty to natural armor does stack, to a maximum penalty equal to the target’s normal full natural armor score.

This style originated among shamanic monks who spent their lives in the wild, allowing them to quickly subdue both game and poachers using the element of surprise. Practitioners of Charging Stag Style can charge fluidly around trees, taking enemies by surprise in the wilderness. When using this style and not mounted, you can charge through difficult terrain, allies and obstacles, making turns if neccessary.

### Cloak and Dagger Subterfuge

Your increased martial skill allows you to take advantage of distracted foes to easily impose conditions, and even steal items without being noticed. While you are using Cloak and Dagger Style and wielding your chosen weapon, whenever you make an attack of opportunity against a target, you can attempt a free dirty trick combat maneuver check against the target as a free action as well. Additionally, whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick maneuver against a target, you can immediately attempt a disarm combat maneuver check against the target as a free action.

### Cloak and Dagger Tactics

You devastate enemies that you catch off-guard. While you are using Cloak and Dagger Style and wielding your chosen weapon, whenever you hit an opponent that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC or that you are flanking, or make an attack using Vital Strike (or its improved or greater versions), you can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check against that opponent as a free action. If you succeed, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or gain the confused condition, if immune, gain the staggered condition, if immune, gain the exhausted condition, if immune, anchored in place and unable to move. This additional penalty lasts only 1 round, regardless of how long the dirty trick’s normal penalty lasts. You can only attempt one free dirty trick combat maneuver check per round using this feat.

### Deific Obedience

Your reverence for a deity is so great that daily prayer and minor sacrifices grant you special boons. Each deity requires a different daily obedience, but all obediences take no more than 1 hour per day to perform. Once you’ve performed the obedience, you gain the benefit of a special ability or resistance as indicated in the Obedience entry for the god to whom you performed the obedience. If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your deity upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed, a boon’s effects are constant.

### Dirty Fighting

You can take advantage of a distracted foe. You can increase the bonus on your attack roll for flanking to +4 for combat maneuver checks. This feat counts as having Dex 13, Int 13, Combat Expertise, and Improved Unarmed Strike for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of the various improved combat maneuver feats, as well as feats that require those improved combat maneuver feats as prerequisites.

### Dirty Trick Master

You are adept at stifling your enemies and can expertly make a bad situation even worse. Whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against an opponent who is still affected by a condition inflicted by a previous dirty trick (whether your own or another creature’s), you can cause the condition to worsen. In addition to increasing the duration of the condition as normal, you cause an opponent who is entangled to become staggered, and sickened to become nauseated. This worsened condition replaces the previous dirty trick condition, and lasts for the duration of the dirty trick.

`DirtyTrickMaster`  

### Diverse Obedience

Your intense faith in your deity allows you to gain boons not granted to most followers. You are treated as though you had 2 more Hit Dice than you actually do for the purposes of determining what divine boons you gain as a result of performing your deity’s obedience. Diverse Obedience doesn’t allow access to divine boons granted through prestige classes early, as those boons are tied to prestige class levels gained, not overall Hit Dice. Additionally, whenever you would gain a boon, you can choose among the options available for exalted or sentinel boons.

### Enhanced Ki Throw

You enhance the force of your ki throws, enabling you to devastate your opponents as you slam them to the ground. Before using the Ki Throw feat, you can expend 1 ki point to amplify the force of your attack. If your ki throw succeeds, when the target hits the ground, it takes damage as if you had hit it with an unarmed strike.

### Arcane Discovery

Wizards spend much of their lives seeking deeper truths, hunting knowledge as if it were life itself. The wizard’s power is not necessarily the spells he wields; spells are merely the outward, most visible manifestation of that power. A wizard’s true power is in his fierce intelligence, his dedication to his craft, and his ability to peel back the surface truths of reality to understand the fundamental underpinnings of existence. A wizard spends much of his time researching spells, and would rather find an undiscovered library than a room full of gold. A wizard need not be a reclusive bookworm, but he must have a burning curiosity for the unknown. Arcane discoveries are the results of this obsession with magic.  
A wizard can learn an arcane discovery in place of a regular feat or wizard bonus feat.

### Shield Mastery

To some combatants shields are just as important, if not more so, than weapons or armor. Shields are multipurpose, capable of defense or offense. They slide on and off far faster than armor, and allow adventurers to change their tactics on a whim. A handful of specialists train to maximize a shield’s use in battle. Presented here are new feats categorized as shield mastery feats, each requiring Shield Focus as a prerequisite. Characters with the armor training class feature can ignore the Shield Focus feat as a prerequisite for shield mastery feats.Shield mastery feats count as combat feats for all purposes, including which classes can select them as bonus feats. You gain the benefits of a shield mastery feat only while wielding a shield with which you are proficient.
