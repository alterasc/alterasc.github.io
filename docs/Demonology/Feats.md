## Apprentice Demonology

Allows you to summon demons of the lowest rank, the Dretch and the Quasit, as well as half demon Cambions. These creatures obey your commands to the best of their ability, and you may telepathically command them to move and use their spellike abilities in the way you see fit. However, bringing any sort of demon to the material plane is an evil and corrupting act. Using these abilities corrupts the soul towards chaos and evil.
