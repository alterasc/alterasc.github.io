## Void Domain

You can call upon the cold darkness between the stars to gain flight, travel to other worlds, or summon monsters from beyond to do your bidding.  
Guarded Mind: You gain a + 2 insight bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting effects.  
It Came From Beyond: Once per day for 2 rounds, you may strengthen your summoning spells, any creatures you summon are more powerful than normal. The creatures gain a bonus to Attack, AC, Initiative, Hit Points and damage equal to 1/2 of total classes that have a domain, as well as gaining 1 extra hasted attack. A summoned creature summoned in this manner appears unnervingly deformed or unnaturally hideous, bringing with it a whiff of the emptiness of the void.  
Domain Spells: feather step, summon monster II, blink, dimension door, summon monster V, overwhelming presence, walk through space, summon monster VIII, summon monster IX.
