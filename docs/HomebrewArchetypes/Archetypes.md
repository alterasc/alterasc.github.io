## Blood Arcanist (Arcanist)

Though most arcanists possess only a rudimentary innate arcane gift, the blood arcanist has the full power of a bloodline to draw upon.

## School Savant (Arcanist)

Some arcanists specialize in a school of magic and trade flexibility for focus. School savants are able to prepare more spells per day than typical arcanists, but their selection is more limited.

## Hateful Rager (Barbarian)

From a young age, many half-orcs are treated cruelly, bullied, ridiculed, and made outcasts. While some hide their shame, others foster a deep, burning hatred that they channel into a raw fury and unleash against their enemies. These half-orcs are called hateful ragers.

## Primal Hunter (Barbarian)

Rather than exploding with anger, primal hunters focus their rage to strike distant targets. Though able to hold their own in melee, primal hunters specialize in using some of the oldest of ranged weapons: bows, slings, and spears.

## Dervish of Dawn (Bard)

Although the dawn goddess is seen mainly as a goddess of healing and redemption in most parts of the world, her stern, evil-smiting element is more common in some areas. Many of her disciples from these lands become dervishes of dawn, religious mystics who use a spinning dance as part of their worship. Many bards of her faith hone their skills with dance and scimitar to become dervish dancers, but some tread a similar path focused more on magic and healing than swordplay. These are the dervishes of dawn.

`DervishofDawn`  

## Stonesinger (Bard)

The traditions of the stonesinger bards hearkens back to its subterranean origins, and is practiced as a form of meditation or worship by many dwarves. Stonesingers are rare bards capable of vocalizing their bardic performances through subsonic harmonies, allowing their performances to carry as subtle vibrations through stone, rather than through the air. They command considerable power underground.

## Strategist (Bard)

Masters of battlefield control, strategists regard combat the way most people would consider a puzzle to be solved. Relying on guile and cunning to outwit their enemies and best aid their allies, the greatest strength of the strategist is in their tactical thinking. They are the champions of plots and ploys, of gambits and fianchettos, of pronged attacks and of victories won through sacrifice. With planning and preparation they are granted unparalleled versatility on the battlefield, able to turn even certain failure to success.

## Bloody-Knuckled Rowdy (Bloodrager)

Bloodragers are frequently rough-and-ready, untrained scrappers who learn to exploit any advantage to gain the upper hand in a fight. The bloody-knuckled rowdy focuses on tricks and maneuvers that are quick and effective, duplicating combat styles from professional brawlers, street thugs, and even trapped animals. Rather than focusing on a single style, most bloody-knuckled rowdies dabble in multiple techniques, mixing and matching their array of vicious maneuvers to suit the occasion.

`BloodKnuckledRager`  

## Untouchable Rager (Bloodrager)

While most bloodragers are known for their inexplicable ability to focus their bloodline into a horrifying mix of martial terror and spellcasting fury, from time to time a bloodrager’s bloodline acts differently. Instead of empowering the bloodrager, it shields the bloodrager from magic of all types, often keeping the bloodrager untouched within the midst of magical effects.

`UntouchableRagerArchetype`

Typically grasping, secretive, and thoroughly mad, Elder Mythos cultists open their bodies and minds to horrifying realities not meant for the sane as they strive to prepare the world for the eventual return of their alien masters.

`b7b9138f2e19b9f45a6ca457f6467710`  
`ElderMythosArchetype`  

## Evangelist (Cleric)

The evangelist is the voice of her religion in the world. Where others nurture the faith among believers, an evangelist proclaims the coming glory of her deific patron and issues the clarion call to all around to heed the truth, or obey the call to war and crusade against the enemies of the church.

`af842d0a0fa41454cbe6a8ae629c2ffd`  
`UndeadLord`  

## Halcyon Druid (Druid)

Halcyon druids are less focused on emulating its inhabitants. Instead, they treat with beings from the Outer Sphere. As a sign of their allegiance, these druids wear fantastical masks depicting celestials, fiends, and-most often-the bestial agathions.  
  
Halcyon druids are peacekeepers, mediating between people and nature, people and the spirit world, and different groups of people. Yet when necessary, they use their magic to fight enemies of peace, especially demons and demon cultists.

`HalcyonDruidArchetype`  

## Berserker (Fighter)

This is a warrior who is in tune with his animalistic side and, during combat, can achieve an ecstatic state of mind that will enable him to fight longer, harder, and more savagely than any person has a right to. Berserkers tend to be barbarian-like in nature, but not always. Sometimes it is a conscious choice that a warrior in training makes. Regardless, opponents on the battlefield will be unsettled when they see the savage and inhuman elements of the Berserker’s personality.

`4ff7206d8c75fac4dbad4501261e50ac`  
`BerserkerArchetype`  

## Viking (Fighter)

The sagas of the northern people are filled with stories of mighty warriors sailing south to raid the peoples of warmer climes and returning with longships filled with plunder. The northerners call these warriors vikings, and their deeds are sung in the longhouses during the long winter nights. A viking strikes fear into the heart of her foes, and in battle can fly into a terrible rage. Many vikings wear the pelts of bears or wolves, drawing on the strength and ferocity of these beasts in battle. Vikings do not wear heavy armor, but are skilled at fighting with an ax or spear in conjunction with a shield.

## Wild Stalker (Ranger)

Civilization grows stronger and more decadent with each passing year. It tears into unclaimed wilderness and destroys the fragile ecology in its constant push for expansion and exploitation. The wild stalker forsakes the bonds of community and lives in the trackless wilds far from others of his kind, or perhaps grew up there, never knowing of civilization as anything more than his enemy. He drives pioneers back to civilization and strives to keep the land unspoiled.
