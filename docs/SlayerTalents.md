### Shadow Duplicate

Once per day as a swift action when the rogue is hit, the rogue creates a single shadow duplicate, as per mirror image. The shadow duplicate lasts for a number of rounds equal to the character’s level, or until the shadow duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell. The caster level for this ability is equal to the character’s level. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 character levels she has (max 4).

### Slowing Strike

An opponent damaged by the slayer's sneak attack has its speed halved for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 of the slayer’s level + the slayer''s Intelligence modifier). If the slayer targets a creature already affected by this ability the duration of the effect is extended by 1d4 rounds.

### Bleeding Attack

A rogue with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue’s sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage.  
Special: Bleeding damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess.
