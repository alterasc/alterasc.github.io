## Summoner

There are those who take a different path when pursuing the arcane arts, reaching across the boundaries of the world to the far-flung planes to call forth all manner of creatures to do their bidding. Known as summoners, these arcane practitioners form close bonds with particular outsiders, known as eidolons, which increase in power along with their callers. In the end, summoners and their eidolons become linked, sharing shards of the same souls.
