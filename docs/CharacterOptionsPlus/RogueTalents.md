# Rogue Talents

## Shadow Duplicate

Once per day as a swift action when the rogue is hit, the rogue creates a single shadow duplicate, as per mirror image. The shadow duplicate lasts for a number of rounds equal to the character’s level, or until the shadow duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell. The caster level for this ability is equal to the character’s level. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 character levels she has (max 4).
