## Armored Marauder

The slayer gains proficiency with heavy armor. In addition, the armor check penalty of any heavy armor the slayer wears is reduced by 1 for every 6 slayer levels he has.

## Shadow Duplicate

Once per day as a swift action when the rogue is hit, the rogue creates a single shadow duplicate, as per mirror image. The shadow duplicate lasts for a number of rounds equal to the character’s level, or until the shadow duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell. The caster level for this ability is equal to the character’s level. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 character levels she has (max 4).

## Slowing Strike

An opponent damaged by the slayer's sneak attack has its speed halved for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 of the slayer’s level + the slayer''s Intelligence modifier). If the slayer targets a creature already affected by this ability the duration of the effect is extended by 1d4 rounds.
