## Burning Disarm

This spell causes the target's weapon to instantly become red hot. The target may attempt a Reflex save to drop it and take no damage, otherwise the hot metal deals 1d4 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 5d4). If the target successfully drops it they are disarmed for 1 round per caster level (maximum 5)

## Chill Touch

A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.  
An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per caster level.

## Consecrate

The DC to resist positive channeled energy within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus. Every undead creature entering a consecrated area suffers a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.  
Undead cannot be summoned while within this area.

## Defensive Shock

Electrical energy floods your body, shocking the next creature that touches you. Any creature striking you in melee takes 1d6 points of electricity damage per two caster levels (maximum 6d6). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies against this damage. Each time the spell discharges, the number of damage dice it deals is halved (rounded down); when the spell’s damage dice reach 0, the spell ends.

## Desecrate

The DC to resist negative channeled energy within this area gains a +3 profane bonus. Every undead creature entering a desecrated area gains a +1 profane bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. Undead summons within such an area gain +1 hit point per HD.  
Anyone who casts Animate Dead within this area creates twice as many undead.

## Dimensional Blade

This spell gives you the power to turn your main-hand melee weapon into a two-dimensional object with length and height but no width.  
Attacks made with the weapon are melee touch attacks that ignore all armor. Force effects, such as mage armor and shield, still apply their AC against attacks made with a dimensional blade. Bludgeoning weapons used to make attacks with this spell deal half damage and are treated as slashing weapons.

## Fleshworm Infestation

With a touch, you cause an infestation of ravenous worms to manifest in the target’s flesh. The target must make a Fortitude save every round. Failure means it takes 1d6 hit points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage, and is staggered for 1 round. If it makes the save, it takes no hit point or Dexterity damage and is only sickened for 1 round rather than staggered. Protection from evil negates this spell’s effects for as long as the two durations overlap. Dispel evil automatically ends a fleshworm infestation.

## Freezing Sphere

Freezing sphere creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 40-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. A creature of the water subtype instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.

`FreezingSphere`  

## Frost Fall

The area of this spell is covered in chilling frost, dealing 2d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within it. Creatures that the spell initially damages must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round. The area remains chilled for the spell’s duration. Any creature that starts its turn within the spell’s area takes 1d6 points of cold damage (Fortitude saving throw for half) but does not become staggered even on a failed saving throw.

`FrostFall`  

## Frostbite

Your melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage + 1 point per level, and the target is fatigued. The fatigued condition ends when the target heals. This spell cannot make a creature exhausted even if it is already fatigued. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.

## Frozen Note

You produce and sustain a single perfect musical note that holds nearby creatures, friend as well as foe, utterly spellbound until you stop singing. Affected creatures are both paralyzed and oblivious to their surroundings so long as you maintain the note.  
Maintaining this note requires your absolute attention; if you take damage or take any other action, including moving from your current square, the spell instantly ends. Creatures that succeed in their initial Saving Throw must make a new one for each round they spend within the area of the spell until they fail and become captivated. Creatures with 4 or more Hit Dice greater than your caster level are not affected by this spell. However, those with 4 or more Hit Dice less than your caster level do not receive a Saving Throw to resist it.

## Hedging Weapons

A weapon made from divine force appears and floats near you.  
This weapon takes the shape of your deity’s favored weapon (if you have no deity, the weapon appears as a longsword). You gain one additional weapon at 6th level and every 4 caster levels thereafter—two at 6th, three at 10th, four at 14th, and a maximum of five weapons at 18th level. The weapon averts and deflects attacks, granting you a +1 deflection bonus to AC for each weapon summoned (maximum +5 at 18th level). As a standard action, you can grasp a weapon and throw it as a ranged attack at any target you can see within 30 feet of you (even if it’s a type of weapon that can’t normally be thrown).  
On a successful hit, the weapon deals 2d6 points of force damage to the target. This force weapon has the same threat range and critical multiplier as a standard weapon of its type, but no other special abilities. Because it deals force damage, DR doesn’t apply.

## Horrific Doubles

You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as mirror image, except as noted.  
Each creature that can see the doubles must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as it can see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the shaken condition and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this spell (beyond the usual effects of mirror image). In addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double shifts at the last second. The double takes on the face of the attacker, the face of a loved one, or some other equally disturbing image, causing the attacker to become frightened for 1 round and take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage from the traumatic shock.

## Ice Slick

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10) and falls prone; creatures that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage and don’t fall prone. Every round any creature in the area must make a successful Reflex save or fall prone.

`IceSlick`  

## Ice Spears

Upon casting this spell, one or more giant spears of ice lance up out of the ground. One spear for every 4 caster levels you possess burst from the ground, targeting a nearby creature. Affected creatures take 2d6 points of piercing damage and 2d6 points of cold damage. When the spears erupt from the ground, they make a combat maneuver check against affected creatures, with a total bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Each additional ice spear beyond the first that strikes a single foe grants a +10 bonus to this CMB check. If the check succeeds, the ice spears knock the foe prone. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the trip attempt.  
If the target is affected by a spell with the cold descriptor, the spears strike with additional force. The DC to save increases by +2 and the spell gains a +4 bonus on its combat maneuver check to trip foes.

## Implosion

This spell causes a destructive resonance in a corporeal creature’s body. Each round you concentrate (including the first), you can cause one creature to collapse in on itself, inflicting 10 points of damage per caster level. If you break concentration, the spell immediately ends, though any implosions that have already happened remain in effect. You can target a particular creature only once with each casting of the spell. Implosion has no effect on incorporeal creatures.

## Invisibility Purge

You surround yourself with a sphere of power that negates all forms of invisibility. The radius of this effect is 5 feet for every 2 caster levels, minimum 5 feet. The maximum radius is 50 feet.

## Judgement Light

An inquisitor may only cast this spell while she has a judgment active. When she does cast this spell, it causes one or more of the following effects based on the inquisitor’s active judgments.  
Destruction: Red light erupts from the caster. Enemies in the area take 4d8 points of damage and become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will saving throw halves the damage and negates the shaken effect.  
Healing: Green light erupts from the caster. Allies in the area regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + the caster’s Wisdom modifier.  
Justice: Blue light erupts from the caster, revealing hidden and invisible creatures to all. The light outlines such creatures for 1 round per caster level, imposing a –20 penalty on Stealth checks on those creatures.  
Piercing: Violet light erupts from the caster, reducing the spell resistance of enemies within the burst by 5 for 1 round per caster level.  
Protection: Amber light erupts from the caster, granting allies in the burst a +2 sacred bonus to AC and CMD, and a +4 bonus to AC against critical confirmation attack rolls for 1 round per caster level.  
Resiliency: Golden light erupts from the caster, granting allies within the burst DR 3 of the same type granted by your judgement.  
Purity: White light erupts from the caster, attempting a dispel check on each ally within the burst with a +2 bonus on the roll.  
Resistance: Copper light erupts from the caster, granting allies within the burst resistance 5 against the energy the judgment protects the inquisitor against when she casts this spell for 1 round per caster level.  
Smiting: Silver light erupts from the caster, making allies’ weapons within the burst count as magic, the alignment her weapon is, and adamantine for purposes of overcoming damage reduction for 1 round per caster level.

## Keen Edge

This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons.  
Multiple effects that increase a weapon’s threat range (such as the keen special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don’t stack. You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.

## Nine Lives

Despite its name, this powerful ward does not grant the target multiple lives, but rather gives the target the ability to get out of trouble and relieves harmful effects and conditions. For the spell’s duration, the target is protected by the following abilities, but only up to a total of nine times, at which point the spell ends.  
Cat's Luck: Reroll a failed saving throw.  
Fortitude: Negate a critical hit or sneak attack.  
Rejuvenate: When reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, immediately heal 3d6 points of damage.  
Shake Off: Negate blinded, confused, cowering, dazed, dazzled, entangled, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, shaken, sickened, or staggered.  
Shimmy Out: Escape from being grappled.  
Stay Up: Do not fall prone.

## Screaming Flames

You blast your foes with fire shaped into skulls screaming in agony. Creatures hit by the fire must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 5d8). Each affected creature must also succeed at a Will save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage.

## Shadow Trap

You pin the target’s shadow to its current location, causing the target to become entangled and preventing it from moving, as if its shadow were anchored to the terrain. 1 round after casting, the target receives a new saving throw to end the effect at the start of each turn.

## Stricken Heart

This spell covers your hand with a writhing black aura. As part of casting the spell, you can make a melee touch attack that deals 2d6 points of negative energy damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1 minute instead. Creatures immune to precision damage are immune to the staggered effect.

## Touch of Blindness

A touch from your hand, which is engulfed in darkness, disrupts a creature’s vision by coating its eyes in supernatural darkness. Each touch causes the target to become blinded for 1 round unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per caster level.

`TouchOfBlindness`  

## Unshakable Zeal

You fill the target with boundless enthusiasm and faith in its ultimate triumph. Whenever the target fails an attack roll, a save, a skill check, or a concentration check, the target receives a +4 morale bonus on its next attempt at the failed check within 1 round (this includes attack rolls against the same foe, saving throws against the same ability from the same foe, and so on). The target also receives a +2 bonus on saving throws against fear and emotion effects.

## Weapon of Awe

You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no Saving Throw.  
This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its ammunition.  
You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, but you can cast it on an unarmed strike.

## Wrath

Choose one enemy creature that you can see within 50 feet. You gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against that designated creature for every three caster levels you have (at least +1, maximum +3). You also receive this bonus on caster level checks made to overcome the creature’s Spell Resistance, if any. At 12th level, you gain the benefits of the Improved Critical feat on attack rolls made against the designated creature. This effect doesn’t stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.
