## Dissipating Touch

Your mere touch can disperse the surface material of a foe or object, sending a tiny portion of it far away. This effect is disruptive; thus, your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage.

## Ectoplasmic Sheen

You draw forth ectoplasm in an area, causing the surface to become slick. Any creature in the area when the power is manifested must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of ectoplasm at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can’t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.  
Augment For every two additional power points you spend augmenting this power, the power’s save DC increases by 1.

## Energy Ray

You create a ray of energy of your active energy type (cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) that shoots forth from your fingertip and strikes a target within range, dealing 1d6 points of damage, if you succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray.  
Cold A ray of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.  
Electricity Manifesting a ray of this energy type provides a +3 bonus on your attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.  
Fire A ray of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.  
Sonic A ray of this energy type deals –1 point of damage per die and ignores an object’s hardness. This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.  
Augment You can augment this power in one of the following ways. 1. For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage increases by one die (d6).  
 2. If you expend your psionic focus when manifesting this power, the cost of the power is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0), but the damage is reduced to 1d3 and it cannot be further augmented.

## Entangling Ectoplasm

You draw forth a glob of ectoplasmic goo from the Astral Plane and immediately throw it as a ranged touch attack at any creature in range. On a successful hit, the subject is covered in goo and becomes entangled. The goo evaporates at the end of the power’s duration. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to 11 + the manifester’s key ability modifier.  
For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save DC increases by 1
