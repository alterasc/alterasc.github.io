# Feats

## Deep Focus

You can psionically focus your subconscious in the same manner in which you gain psionic focus normally. At any time when you need to expend your psionic focus, you can expend your subconscious’s psionic focus instead. At any time when you need to maintain psionic focus for an effect, you can use your subconscious’s psionic focus instead. Psionically focusing your subconscious works just like focusing your conscious mind.

## Psionic Shot

While you maintain psionic focus, your attacks with a ranged weapon deal an extra 1 point of damage. Additionally, if you expend your psionic focus as part of an attack with a ranged weapon, that attack instead deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. You must decide whether or not to use this feat prior to making an attack. If your attack misses, you still expend your psionic focus.

## Wild Talent

Your latent power of psionics flares to life, conferring upon you the designation of a psionic character. As a psionic character, you gain a reserve of 2 power points and can take psionic feats, metapsionic feats, and psionic item creation feats. You do not, however, gain the ability to manifest powers simply by virtue of having this feat. Additionally, you can take this feat multiple times. The first, you gain 2 additional power points, every other time, you gain only one.
