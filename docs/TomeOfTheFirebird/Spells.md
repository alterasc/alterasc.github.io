## Chains Of Fire

This spell functions like chain lightning, except as noted above, and the spell deals fire damage instead of electricity damage.   
   
Chain Lightning: This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike lightning bolt, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.  
The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt.  
Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. Secondary targets must be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once.

## Entropic Shield

A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for which the attacker must make an attack roll has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effects of concealment). Other attacks that simply work at a distance are not affected.

## Fire Shield

This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee.The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if you choose cool or warm flames for your fire shield.   
 Any creature striking you with its body or a hand-held weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level(maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage(if you choose a chill shield) or fire damage(if you choose a warm shield). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect.Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.  
 When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light.The color of the flames is blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or red if the warm shield is employed.The special powers of each version are as follows.   
Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch.You take only half damage from fire-based attacks.If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.  
Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch.You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

## Gloomblind Bolts

You create one or more bolts of negative energy infused with shadow pulled from the Shadow Plane. You can fire one bolt, plus one for every four levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of three bolts at 13th level) at the same or different targets, but all bolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and require a ranged touch attack to hit. Each bolt deals 4d6 points of damage to a living creature or heals 4d6 points of damage to an undead creature. Furthermore, the bolt’s energy spreads over the skin of creature, possibly blinding it for a short time. Any creature struck by a bolt must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or become blinded for 1 round.

## Heal Mount

This spell functions like heal, but it affects only the paladin’s special mount (typically a horse).   
 Heal:Heal enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.   
 Heal does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.

## Keen Edge

This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows.This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon.A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons.If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target.Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.   
  
 Multiple effects that increase a weapon’s threat range (such as the keen special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don’t stack.You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.

## Spear Of Purity

You hurl a pure white or golden spear of light from your holy symbol, affecting any one target within range as a ranged touch attack.  
  
An evil creature struck by the spear takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An evil outsider instead takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level(maximum 10d6) and is blinded for 1 round.A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the blinded effect. This spell deals only half damage to creatures that are neither evil nor good, and they are not blinded. The spear has no effect on good creatures.

## Vitrolic Mist

This spell wreathes you in acid mists and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee. The mists also protect you from acid-based attacks. You take only half damage from acid-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.   
 Any creature striking you with its body or a hand-held weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point per caster level(maximum +15). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.
