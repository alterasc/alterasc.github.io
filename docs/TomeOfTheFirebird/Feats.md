`AbilityFocusBreathWeapon`  

## Ancestral Scorn

The fury you harbor for your fiendish ancestors gives evil outsiders great reason to fear you.  
Benefit: Whenever you successfully demoralize an outsider of the evil subtype with an Intimidate check, it becomes sickened for 1 round in addition to being affected by the normal effects of being demoralized. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, the creature is nauseated for 1 round instead.

## Armor Of The Pit

You gain a +2 natural armor bonus.  
 Special: If you have the scaled skin racial trait, you instead gain +1 natural armor and resistance 5 to two of the following energy types that you don’t have resistance to already: cold, electricity, and fire

## Coordinated Shot

If your ally with this feat is threatening an opponent and is not providing cover to that opponent against your ranged attacks, you gain a +1 bonus on ranged attacks against that opponent. If your ally with this feat is flanking that opponent with another ally (even if that other ally doesn’t have this feat), this bonus increases to +2.

## Discordant Song

Whenever you are using bardic performance to create a spell-like or supernatural effect, allies within 30 feet of you deal an extra 1d6 points of sonic damage with successful weapon attacks. This damage stacks with other energy damage a weapon might deal. Projectile weapons bestow this extra damage on their ammunition, but the extra damage is dealt only if the projectile hits a target within 30 feet of you.

## Extended Buffer

You may increase the amount of burn you can store within your Internal Buffer class feature by 1.  
Special: This feat may be taken once at 7th level, and again at 13th and 19th.

## Lastwall Phalanx

You gain a sacred bonus to your AC against the attacks of evil creatures and a sacred bonus to saves against the spells and abilities of evil creatures equal to the number of adjacent allies who also have this feat.

`LastwallPhalanxFeat`  

## Metamagic (Twin Spell)

You can modify a spell to strike twice.  
Benefit: The spell takes effect twice in the same area or on the same target simultaneously. Any variable characteristics or decisions you would make about the spell (including target and area), are applied to both spells, with affected creatures receiving all the effects of each spell individually (including getting two saving throws if applicable). A spell whose effects wouldn't stack if it was cast twice under normal circumstances will create redundant effects if successfully twinned. Note that   
Level Increase: +4.  
Many (but not all) buff and debuff spells will not benefit from being twinned, even at the level of needing to be dispelled twice, because of implementation details.

`TwinSpellFeat`  

## Prodigious Two-Weapon Fighting

You may fight with a one-handed weapon in your offhand as if it were a light weapon. In addition, you may use your Strength score instead of your Dexterity score for the purpose of qualifying for Two-Weapon Fighting and any feats with Two-Weapon Fighting as a prerequisite.

`ProdigiousTWF`  

## Sundering Strike

Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can sunder your opponent’s weapon, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent’s CMD, you may deal damage to your opponent’s weapon as if from the sunder combat maneuver (roll normal damage to the weapon separately). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

`7d0d7fef52374d12b64eec9286809b27`  
`SunderingStrike`  

## Swarm Strike

Whenever a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you gain a +1 bonus on your attack roll, plus an additional +1 bonus for each ally who also has this feat and currently threatens that foe.
