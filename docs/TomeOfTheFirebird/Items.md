## Bracers Of The Avenging Knight

These silver bracers are polished to a mirrored sheen, but otherwise shift their appearance to match whatever suit of armor they are worn with.  
 If the wearer has levels in a class that grants a smite ability (such as a paladin or hellknight), her smite damage is treated as though she were a member of that class four levels higher..

## Bracers Of The Merciful Knight
