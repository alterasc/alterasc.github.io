# Feats

## Acadamae Graduate

Whenever you cast a prepared arcane spell from the Conjuration school with the Summoning descriptor that takes a full-round action to cast, reduce the casting time to a standard action. Casting a spell in this way is taxing and requires a Fortitude save (DC 15 + spell level) to resist becoming fatigued for 1 minute. If you are already fatigued or exhausted the casting time is not reduced.

## Earth Magic

You can draw raw magical energy from the ground to empower your spells.  
Benefit: While you’re in your favored terrain, your effective caster level increases by 1 for the purpose of improving spell effects dependent on caster level. This increase in effective caster level doesn’t grant you access to more spells.

## Fiendish Blessing

At 2nd level, 6th level, 10th level, 14th level, 18th level and 20th level, a warlock receives a new fiendish blessing. The warlock must select a fiendish blessing offered by his patron or one listed as a general fiendish blessing. Once selected, this blessing cannot be changed. Unless otherwise stated, each blessing can be chosen only once.  
Whenever a warlock would gain a feat, he may instead select a fiendish blessing he qualifies for.

## Theurgy

You can blend the power of arcane and divine magic.  
Benefit: You can augment the power of your divine spells with arcane energy and augment your arcane spells with divine energy.  
When casting a divine spell, you may sacrifice an arcane spell slot or arcane prepared spell of that spell’s level or higher as a swift action. The caster level for that divine spell increases by +1. Conversely, you can sacrifice a divine spell slot to increase the caster level of an arcane spell instead.

## Witch Knife

You empower your witch spells by incorporating the use of a special ceremonial knife during your castings.
