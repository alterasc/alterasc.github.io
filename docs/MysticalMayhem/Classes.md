## Warlock

Warlocks draw their power from pacts and dealings with powerful inhabitants of the lower planes. The power of such planes courses through their veins. The struggle to control these forces and resist being controlled by them remains a constant struggle for Warlocks.  
The very nature of a warlock makes them feared and targeted by most societies and denizens of good. As such many warlocks look to hide their abilities and connections to the lower planes. Some look for communities that accept them, others make their own. Their tools favor an offensive and proactive mindset.

Archetypes:  
 - Invoker
