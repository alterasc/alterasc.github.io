# New spells

## Bloody Tears and Jagged Smile

Your eyes turn black and weep blood, and your teeth become jagged fangs. You gain a bite attack (1d3 points of damage if you are Small, 1d4 points of damage if you are Medium). You gain a +4 profane bonus on Intimidate checks and on your spell DCs for spells with the fear descriptor.

## Draconic Malice

You surround yourself with a palpable aura of draconic fear and dread.  
Living creatures within this aura that are normally immune to fear or mind-affecting abilities lose those immunities against your spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that create fear effects, as well as any Intimidate checks you attempt to demoralize foes.

## Mighty Strength

The subject becomes stronger. The spell grants a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength, adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier.

## Spell Turning

Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to stop touch range spells. From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning. The exact number is rolled secretly.  
If you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell harmessly dissipates instead of harming its caster.

## Sure Casting

You gain temporary insight into your enemies’ magical defenses. When you next cast a spell before the end of the next round, treat your caster level as 5 higher than normal for the purpose of overcoming spell resistance. This bonus doesn’t increase any other effects that depend on caster level, such as the spell’s damage or range, and affects only the first spell cast after sure casting.
