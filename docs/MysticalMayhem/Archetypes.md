# Archetypes

## Flagellant (Cleric)

A flagellant believes pain and suffering lead to the realization of the divine. A common method of flagellation is to whip a leather strap across her shoulders while praying. Other flagellants scour their limbs with blades. Their wounds proclaim their devotion, and the self-inflicted agony focuses their belief.

## Warsighted (Oracle)

A warsighted’s unique gifts are not in strange magical revelations, but in her ability to adapt in the midst of a battle with new fighting techniques.

## Razmiran Priest (Sorcerer)

The so-called “priests” of Razmir are magical charlatans—missionary servants of the Living God who spread his fervent devotion wherever they travel. Altered by Razmir’s magic, they can perform feats impossible for other sorcerers.

## Gold-Robed Wizard (Wizard)

Most who strive to protect the world and its peoples from the forces of evil turn to shining steel and the magic of the gods. There is another kind of holy champion, however, who harnesses the power of the arcane to defend the innocent. These mages in their golden robes become masters at smiting the wicked with eldritch force, conjuring holy beings to do battle against their foes, and banishing fiends back to their vile pits.

## Pact Wizard (Wizard)

While the art of wizardry is usually a scholar’s pursuit, there are those who seek mastery of arcane power without tedious study and monotonous research. Motivated by foolish ambition, such individuals turn to the greatest enigmas of the cosmos in the hopes of attaining greater power. Though few successfully attract the attention of these forces, those who do receive phenomenal arcane power for their efforts, but become the dutiful playthings and servants of the forces with which they consort.
