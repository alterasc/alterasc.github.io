### Atavism

By bringing forth the primeval ancestry of the target animal, you awaken a savage engine of destruction. The animal immediately gains the advanced creature simple template. It gains a +2 bonus on all rolls, including damage rolls and special ability DCs, a +4 bonus to AC and CMD, and +2 hit points per HD. The animals primal instincts take hold for the duration of this spell—if the animal knows tricks granted by the Lore (Nature) skill, it loses access to all of those tricks save for attack.

### Strong Jaw

Laying a hand upon an allied creatures jaw, claws, tentacles, or other natural weapons, you enhance the power of that creatures natural attacks. Each natural attack that creature makes deals damage as if the creature were two sizes larger than it actually is. If the creature is already Gargantuan or Colossal-sized, double the amount of damage dealt by each of its natural attacks instead. This spell does not actually change the creature’s size; all of its statistics except the amount of damage dealt by its natural attacks remain unchanged.

This spell causes the target's weapon to instantly become red hot.

### Chill Touch

A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.  
An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per caster level.

The DC to resist positive channeled energy within this area gains a +3 sacred bonus. Every undead creature entering a consecrated area suffers a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.  
Undead cannot be summoned while within this area.

### Defensive Shock

Electrical energy floods your body, shocking the next creature that touches you. Any creature striking you in melee takes 1d6 points of electricity damage per two caster levels (maximum 6d6). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies against this damage. Each time the spell discharges, the number of damage dice it deals is halved (rounded down); when the spell’s damage dice reach 0, the spell ends.

Anyone who casts Animate Dead within this area creates twice as many undead.

### Dimensional Blade

This spell gives you the power to turn your main-hand melee weapon into a two-dimensional object with length and height but no width.  
Attacks made with the weapon are melee touch attacks that ignore all armor. Force effects, such as mage armor and shield, still apply their AC against attacks made with a dimensional blade. Bludgeoning weapons used to make attacks with this spell deal half damage and are treated as slashing weapons.

### Fleshworm Infestation

With a touch, you cause an infestation of ravenous worms to manifest in the target’s flesh. The target must make a Fortitude save every round. Failure means it takes 1d6 hit points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage, and is staggered for 1 round. If it makes the save, it takes no hit point or Dexterity damage and is only sickened for 1 round rather than staggered. Protection from evil negates this spell’s effects for as long as the two durations overlap. Dispel evil automatically ends a fleshworm infestation.

### Freezing Sphere

Freezing sphere creates a frigid globe of cold energy that streaks from your fingertips to the location you select, where it explodes in a 40-foot-radius burst, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to each creature in the area. A creature of the water subtype instead takes 1d8 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d8) and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.

Wizard 6, Magus 6

`FreezingSphere`  

### Frost Fall

The area of this spell is covered in chilling frost, dealing 2d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within it. Creatures that the spell initially damages must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round. The area remains chilled for the spell’s duration. Any creature that starts its turn within the spell’s area takes 1d6 points of cold damage (Fortitude saving throw for half) but does not become staggered even on a failed saving throw.

Witch 2, Wizard 2, Druid 2, Winter Witch 2

`904d8cf838b24289b041f3ce573e707d`  
`FrostFall`  

### Frostbite

Your melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage + 1 point per level, and the target is fatigued. The fatigued condition ends when the target heals. This spell cannot make a creature exhausted even if it is already fatigued. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.

`Frostbite`  

### Frozen Note

You produce and sustain a single perfect musical note that holds nearby creatures, friend as well as foe, utterly spellbound until you stop singing. Affected creatures are both paralyzed and oblivious to their surroundings so long as you maintain the note.  
Maintaining this note requires your absolute attention; if you take damage or take any other action, including moving from your current square, the spell instantly ends. Creatures that succeed in their initial Saving Throw must make a new one for each round they spend within the area of the spell until they fail and become captivated. Creatures with 4 or more Hit Dice greater than your caster level are not affected by this spell. However, those with 4 or more Hit Dice less than your caster level do not receive a Saving Throw to resist it.

Bard 5

`FrozenNote`  

### Hedging Weapons

A weapon made from divine force appears and floats near you.  
This weapon takes the shape of your deity’s favored weapon (if you have no deity, the weapon appears as a longsword). You gain one additional weapon at 6th level and every 4 caster levels thereafter—two at 6th, three at 10th, four at 14th, and a maximum of five weapons at 18th level. The weapon averts and deflects attacks, granting you a +1 deflection bonus to AC for each weapon summoned (maximum +5 at 18th level). As a standard action, you can grasp a weapon and throw it as a ranged attack at any target you can see within 30 feet of you (even if it’s a type of weapon that can’t normally be thrown).  
On a successful hit, the weapon deals 2d6 points of force damage to the target. This force weapon has the same threat range and critical multiplier as a standard weapon of its type, but no other special abilities. Because it deals force damage, DR doesn’t apply.

### Horrific Doubles

You create several illusory doubles of yourself, where you and each image all seem slightly off or wrong in appearance. Treat this spell as mirror image, except as noted.  
Each creature that can see the doubles must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for as long as it can see any of the doubles. A successful saving throw negates the shaken condition and renders the creature immune to the further effects of this spell (beyond the usual effects of mirror image). In addition, the first time a creature that failed its initial saving throw destroys one of the images, it must succeed at a Will save or its perception of the double shifts at the last second. The double takes on the face of the attacker, the face of a loved one, or some other equally disturbing image, causing the attacker to become frightened for 1 round and take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage from the traumatic shock.

`HorrificDoubles`  

### Ice Slick

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10) and falls prone; creatures that succeed at a Reflex save take half damage and don’t fall prone. Every round any creature in the area must make a successful Reflex save or fall prone.

Witch 2, Wizard 2, Druid 2, Magus 2, Ranger 2, Winter Witch 2

`IceSlick`  

### Ice Spears

Upon casting this spell, one or more giant spears of ice lance up out of the ground. One spear for every 4 caster levels you possess burst from the ground, targeting a nearby creature. Affected creatures take 2d6 points of piercing damage and 2d6 points of cold damage. When the spears erupt from the ground, they make a combat maneuver check against affected creatures, with a total bonus equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. Each additional ice spear beyond the first that strikes a single foe grants a +10 bonus to this CMB check. If the check succeeds, the ice spears knock the foe prone. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the trip attempt.  
If the target is affected by a spell with the cold descriptor, the spears strike with additional force. The DC to save increases by +2 and the spell gains a +4 bonus on its combat maneuver check to trip foes.

### Implosion

This spell causes a destructive resonance in a corporeal creature’s body. Each round you concentrate (including the first), you can cause one creature to collapse in on itself, inflicting 10 points of damage per caster level. If you break concentration, the spell immediately ends, though any implosions that have already happened remain in effect. You can target a particular creature only once with each casting of the spell. Implosion has no effect on incorporeal creatures.

### Invisibility Purge

You surround yourself with a sphere of power that negates all forms of invisibility. The radius of this effect is 5 feet for every 2 caster levels, minimum 5 feet. The maximum radius is 50 feet.

### Judgement Light

An inquisitor may only cast this spell while she has a judgment active. When she does cast this spell, it causes one or more of the following effects based on the inquisitor’s active judgments.  
Destruction: Red light erupts from the caster. Enemies in the area take 4d8 points of damage and become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will saving throw halves the damage and negates the shaken effect.  
Healing: Green light erupts from the caster. Allies in the area regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + the caster’s Wisdom modifier.  
Justice: Blue light erupts from the caster, revealing hidden and invisible creatures to all. The light outlines such creatures for 1 round per caster level, imposing a –20 penalty on Stealth checks on those creatures.  
Piercing: Violet light erupts from the caster, reducing the spell resistance of enemies within the burst by 5 for 1 round per caster level.  
Protection: Amber light erupts from the caster, granting allies in the burst a +2 sacred bonus to AC and CMD, and a +4 bonus to AC against critical confirmation attack rolls for 1 round per caster level.  
Resiliency: Golden light erupts from the caster, granting allies within the burst DR 3 of the same type granted by your judgement.  
Purity: White light erupts from the caster, attempting a dispel check on each ally within the burst with a +2 bonus on the roll.  
Resistance: Copper light erupts from the caster, granting allies within the burst resistance 5 against the energy the judgment protects the inquisitor against when she casts this spell for 1 round per caster level.  
Smiting: Silver light erupts from the caster, making allies’ weapons within the burst count as magic, the alignment her weapon is, and adamantine for purposes of overcoming damage reduction for 1 round per caster level.

### Keen Edge

This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows. This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons.  
Multiple effects that increase a weapon’s threat range (such as the keen special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don’t stack. You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.

### Nine Lives

Despite its name, this powerful ward does not grant the target multiple lives, but rather gives the target the ability to get out of trouble and relieves harmful effects and conditions. For the spell’s duration, the target is protected by the following abilities, but only up to a total of nine times, at which point the spell ends.  
Cat's Luck: Reroll a failed saving throw.  
Fortitude: Negate a critical hit or sneak attack.  
Rejuvenate: When reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, immediately heal 3d6 points of damage.  
Shake Off: Negate blinded, confused, cowering, dazed, dazzled, entangled, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, shaken, sickened, or staggered.  
Shimmy Out: Escape from being grappled.  
Stay Up: Do not fall prone.

### Screaming Flames

You blast your foes with fire shaped into skulls screaming in agony. Creatures hit by the fire must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d8 points of fire damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 5d8). Each affected creature must also succeed at a Will save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage.

`ScreamingFlames`  

### Shadow Trap

You pin the target’s shadow to its current location, causing the target to become entangled and preventing it from moving, as if its shadow were anchored to the terrain. 1 round after casting, the target receives a new saving throw to end the effect at the start of each turn.

Warpriest 1, Witch 1, Wizard 1, Bard 1, Bloodrager 1, Cleric 1, Shaman 1, Dread Knight 1, Antipaladin 1, Winter Witch 1, Child of Acavna and Amaznen 1, Claw of the False Wyrm 1

`ShadowTrap`  

### Stricken Heart

This spell covers your hand with a writhing black aura. As part of casting the spell, you can make a melee touch attack that deals 2d6 points of negative energy damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1 minute instead. Creatures immune to precision damage are immune to the staggered effect.

Witch 2, Wizard 2, Inquisitor 2, Shaman 2, Winter Witch 2, Ravener Hunter 2

### Touch of Blindness

A touch from your hand, which is engulfed in darkness, disrupts a creature’s vision by coating its eyes in supernatural darkness. Each touch causes the target to become blinded for 1 round unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per caster level.

`TouchOfBlindness`  

### Unshakable Zeal

You fill the target with boundless enthusiasm and faith in its ultimate triumph. Whenever the target fails an attack roll, a save, a skill check, or a concentration check, the target receives a +4 morale bonus on its next attempt at the failed check within 1 round (this includes attack rolls against the same foe, saving throws against the same ability from the same foe, and so on). The target also receives a +2 bonus on saving throws against fear and emotion effects.

Bard 5, Inquisitor 5, Ravener Hunter 5

`UnshakableZeal`  

### Weapon of Awe

You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no Saving Throw.  
This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its ammunition.  
You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, but you can cast it on an unarmed strike.

### Wrath

Choose one enemy creature that you can see within 50 feet. You gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against that designated creature for every three caster levels you have (at least +1, maximum +3). You also receive this bonus on caster level checks made to overcome the creature’s Spell Resistance, if any. At 12th level, you gain the benefits of the Improved Critical feat on attack rolls made against the designated creature. This effect doesn’t stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.

### Bladed Dash

When you cast this spell, you immediately move up to 30 feet in a straight line any direction, momentarily leaving a multi-hued cascade of images behind you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You may make a single melee attack at your highest base attack bonus against any one creature you are adjacent to at any point along this 30 feet. You gain a circumstance bonus on your attack roll equal to your Intelligence or Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. You must end the bonus movement granted by this spell in an unoccupied space. Despite the name, the spell works with any melee weapon.

### Bladed Dash, Greater

This spell functions like bladed dash, save that you can make a single melee attack against every creature you pass during the 30 feet of your dash. You cannot attack an individual creature more than once with this spell.

### Chill Touch

A touch from your hand, which glows with blue energy, disrupts the life force of living creatures. Each touch channels negative energy that deals 1d6 points of damage. The touched creature also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it makes a successful Fortitude saving throw. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.  
An undead creature you touch takes no damage of either sort, but it must make a successful Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4 rounds + 1 round per caster level.

### Divine Trident

A 4-foot-long, blazing, forked bolt of electricity springs forth from your hand. You wield this spear-like bolt as if it were a trident (you are considered proficient with the bolt). Attacks with Gozreh’s trident are melee touch attacks. The bolt deals 1d8 points of electricity damage + 1 point per 2 caster levels (maximum +10). Since the bolt is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. The bolt can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

### Flame Blade

A 3-foot-long, blazing beam of red-hot fire springs forth from your hand. You wield this blade-like beam as if it were a scimitar. Attacks with the flame blade are melee touch attacks. The blade deals 1d8 points of fire damage + 1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10). Since the blade is immaterial, your Strength modifier does not apply to the damage. A flame blade can ignite combustible materials such as parchment, straw, dry sticks, and cloth.

### Frostbite

Your melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage + 1 point per level, and the target is fatigued. The fatigued condition ends when the target recovers from the nonlethal damage. This spell cannot make a creature exhausted even if it is already fatigued. You can use this melee touch attack up to one time per level.

`Frostbite_Cast`  

### Healing Flames

You unleash a blast of holy flames that washes over all creatures in the area in a glorious display of divine power. This deals damage to evil creatures and heals good creatures in the area. The amount of damage dealt and the number of hit points restored in each case is 1d8 points per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8).  
Half of the damage this spell deals to evil creatures is fire damage, and half of the damage is pure divine power that is therefore not subject to reduction by energy resistance to fire-based attacks.  
Neutral enemies within the spell’s area of effect also take the fire damage, but do not take the divine damage. Neutral allies within the area are healed like good creatures. A successful Reflex saving throw halves the damage taken in all cases.

### Produce Flame

Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm neither you nor your equipment.  
In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies. You can strike an opponent with a ranged touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.

### Acid Maw

Your animal companion's bite attack deals an additional 1d4 points of acid damage, and the acid deals another 1d4 points of acid damage to the target on the next round. The acid continues to deal damage for 1 additional round per 4 caster levels (to a maximum of 6 total rounds at caster level 20th). This ongoing acid damage doesn't stack from multiple attacks, but the duration resets if a newer bite would cause the ongoing damage to last longer than the duration remaining from a previous one. The acid does not harm the animal companion.

### Archon's Aura

You gain a powerful aura, similar to an archon's aura of menace. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of you must succeed at a Will save to resist the effects of this aura. If the creature fails, it takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws and to Armor Class for the duration of this spell, or until it successfully hits you with an attack. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by this particular casting of archon's aura.

### Aspect of the Falcon

You take on an aspect of a falcon. Your eyes become wide and raptor-like, and you grow feathers on the sides of your head. You gain a +3 competence bonus on Perception checks, a +1 competence bonus on ranged attacks, and the critical multiplier for your bows and crossbows becomes 19–20/×3.  
This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon, such as the Improved Critical feat or a keen weapon.

### Aspect of the Wolf

When you cast this spell, you take on an aspect of a wolf, including some of its physical characteristics. You become more rugged, your ears become elongated, and you sprout sharp fangs and fur.  
You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity, a +2 enhancement bonus on trip attacks, and can make a trip combat maneuver as a swift action. This trip attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

### Barkskin

Barkskin toughens a creature's skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at 12th level.  
The enhancement bonus provided by barkskin stacks with the target's natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.

Druid 2

### Bestow Grace of the Champion

You channel the power of good and law into the target, temporarily giving it powers similar to those of a paladin. The target gains immunity to diseases and immunity to fear. It adds its Charisma bonus to all its saving throws. This spell has no effect if cast on a paladin. Target has to be lawful good.

### Burning Entanglement

This spell functions as entangle, except it sets the foliage on fire. A creature that begins its turn entangled by the spell takes 4d6 points of fire damage (a successful Reflex save halves this damage), and a creature that begins its turn in the area but is not entangled takes 2d6 points of fire damage (a successful Reflex save negates this damage). Smoke rising from the vines partially obscures visibility. Attacks made in the smoke or against anything in the smoke must contend with concealment (20% miss chance). When the spell's duration expires, the vines burn away entirely.

Druid 3

`HalcyonBurningEntangle3`  

### Call Lightning

Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 6-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell's range (measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the target point or in the path of the bolt is affected. You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed first. Each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. Each time you cast a bolt, the spell's duration is reduced by one minute.

Druid 3

`44b9694105cb4fd1a730c9e0b7105977`  
`HalcyonCallLightning3`  

### Call Lightning Storm

This spell functions like call lightning, except that each bolt deals 5d6 points of electricity damage at long range, and you may call a maximum of 15 bolts.

Druid 5

`9ffb645d4c764d7c86ffa74032be6fa6`  
`HalcyonCallLightningStorm5`  

### Cape of Wasps

You summon a wasp swarm, which does not attack you. The dense cloud of vermin gives you partial concealment against ranged attacks. Any creature that makes a successful melee attack against you takes 2d6 points of swarm damage and poison from the wasp swarm, but is not affected by the swarm's distraction ability.

Druid 4

`b9a18fb479ce46728f9994c1b8ac6eb3`  
`HalcyonCapeOfWasps4`  

### Cave Fangs

You create a magical trap in the area that causes deadly stalactites or stalagmites to "bite" an intruder. The magical trap is triggered whenever an enemy creature moves through the affected area. The effect of cave fangs depends on whether you create stalactites or stalagmites (see below). You can place these traps anywhere within close range as free action for the duration of the spell; the trap's radius is 5 feet. Each time you place a trap, the spell's duration is reduced by 10 minutes.  
Stalactites: Shards of rock drop from above, dealing 3d8 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage (Reflex half). A creature that fails its Reflex save is pinned to the ground under stalactites and rubble, gaining the entangled condition until it can free itself with a successful DC 15 Strength check or DC 20 Mobility check.  
Stalagmites: Piercing spires of rock erupt up from the ground, dealing 3d8 points of piercing damage and knocking the creature prone (a successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage and avoids being knocked prone). Once the stalagmites appear, they function thereafter as spike stones for 1 minute per caster level and then crumble to dust.

Druid 5

### Changestaff

This spell changes an ordinary quarterstaff into a treant creature. It appears where you designate and acts according to its initiative check results. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability.

`HalcyonChangestaff7`  

### Creeping Doom

This spell summons to your side 4 spider swarms. The summoned swarms appear where you designate and act according to their initiative check results. They attack your opponents to the best of their ability.  
The swarms have 60 hit points each and deal 4d6 points of damage with their swarm attack plus poison and distraction. The save to resist their poison and distraction effects is equal to the save DC of this spell.  
Distraction: A creature with this ability can nauseate the creatures that it damages. Any living creature that takes damage from a creature with the distraction ability is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save negates the effect.  
Poison: Swarm — injury; Fortitude save; frequency: 1/round for 6 rounds; effect: 1d4 Dex damage; cure: 1 save.

Druid 7

### Crusader's Edge

When you cast this spell on a melee weapon in your primary hand, you imbue it with a powerful holy energy, granting your primary weapon the bane weapon quality against evil outsiders. Furthermore, whenever you score a successful critical hit against an outsider with the evil subtype, you not only deal normal critical damage with the weapon but also nauseate the outsider for 1d3 rounds — the outsider can reduce this nauseated condition to sickened for 1 round with a successful Fortitude save.

Druid 4

`HalcyonCrusadersEdgeCast4`  

### Cure Critical Wounds

When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 4d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

### Death Ward

The subject gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against all death spells and magical death effects. The subject is immune to energy drain and any negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy. This spell does not remove negative levels that the subject has already gained and does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even if those attacks might be lethal.

Druid 5

`2d6551c685234e878c417b2f2c4782c5`  
`HalcyonDeathWardCast5`  

### Delay Poison

The subject becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the subject until the spell's duration has expired. Delay poison does not cure any damage that poison may have already done.

Druid 2

`5b66e347866349aea7397ce96584586d`  
`HalcyonDelayPoison2`  

### Delay Poison, Communal

### Dominate Animal

This spell functions like dominate person, except that the spell is restricted by creature type: animal.

Druid 3

`2e665bceb9c9452ba4fbec80e0b015e3`  
`HalcyonDominateAnimal3`  

### Eaglesoul

You call forth a surge of holy power, which grants you the following benefits: a +2 sacred bonus to AC, a +4 sacred bonus to Strength, resistance 5 to acid and fire, a +5 sacred bonus on all Persuasion (when used to intimidate) checks made against evil creatures, a +2 bonus on initiative checks, and fast healing 2. Any critical threat roll made against an evil creature with a weapon you wield is automatically confirmed.  
Non-good spellcasters can cast this spell, but doing so causes them to be sickened (for spellcasters who are neither good nor evil) or staggered (for spellcasters who are evil) for the spell's duration.

Druid 6

`5642fce37e2a4db185168fb959791712`  
`HalcyonEaglesoul6`  

### Elemental Swarm

This spell opens a portal to an Elemental Plane and summons elementals from it. When the spell is complete, 2d4 large elementals appear. Five rounds later, 1d4 huge elementals appear. Five rounds after that, one greater elemental appears. The summoned elementals appear where you designate and act according to their initiative check results. They attack your opponents to the best of their ability.

Druid 9

### Entangle

This spell causes tall grass, weeds, and other plants to wrap around creatures in the area of effect or those that enter the area. Creatures that fail their Reflex save gain the entangled condition. Creatures that succeed at their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again each round. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately.  
Entangled creatures can break free by making a combat maneuver check, Athletics check, or Mobility check against the DC of this spell every round.  
The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts.

Druid 1

`8babdc47898c4794803becb5f981a55c`  
`HalcyonEntangle1`  

### Explosion of Rot

You call forth a burst of decay that ravages all creatures in the area. Even non-living creatures such as constructs and undead crumble or wither in this malignant eruption of rotting energy. Creatures in the area of effect take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and are staggered for 1d4 rounds. A target that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw takes half damage and negates the staggered effect. Plant creatures are particularly susceptible to this rotting effect; a plant creature caught in the burst suffers a –2 penalty on the saving throw and takes 1 extra point of damage per die.

Druid 4

`613e9db7e6f54bf39b88ceda8fda6de1`  
`HalcyonExplosionOfRot4`  

### Faerie Fire

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by faerie fire take a –20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light.

Druid 1

`7a33251d68404c809d987dbc9030ad0a`

### Fire Storm

When a fire storm spell is cast, the whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame. All enemy creatures within the area take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). Creatures that fail their Reflex save catch on fire, taking 4d6 points of fire damage each round after that until the flames are extinguished by making a successful Reflex save.

Druid 7

`e83f79fc89164c69bf846c2e3461860e`  
`HalcyonFireStorm7`  

### Firebelly

A magical fire warms your belly, granting you fire resistance 5 and making your gut hot to the touch (but not enough to damage you or anything else). As a standard action, you can breathe a 15-foot cone of flame that deals 1d4 points of fire damage (Reflex half, SR applies). Each time you use this breath weapon, the remaining duration of the spell is reduced by 1 minute.

Druid 1

`4f8becd222c44cb3a65661c8e8833c04`  
`HalcyonFirebelly1`  

### Flame Strike

A flame strike evokes a vertical column of divine fire. The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks.

Druid 4

`87586c503e4f47978c14d8cf90ec8dee`  
`HalcyonFlameStrike4`  

### Freedom of Movement

This spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, such as paralysis, slow, and web. All combat maneuver checks made to grapple the target automatically fail.

Druid 4

`4153fad17b784a3f9bf4f2eb9ccff719`  
`HalcyonFreedomOfMovementCast4`  

### Fungal Infestation

You coat the target in necrotic fungus that makes its flesh soft and fragile. The target takes 1d3 points of Charisma damage. Any physical attack against the target automatically adds 1d6 points of bleed damage. If the target dies while under the effect, all creatures within 15 feet of the target take 1d8 negative energy damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 10d8) and must succeed at a Fortitude save or themselves gain the effects of the original fungal infestation spell. This is a disease effect.

Druid 3

`b4576742098440feae5c1105cd69faf6`  
`HalcyonFungalInfestationAbility3`  

### Guidance

This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance.

### Heal

Heal enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.  
Heal does not remove negative levels or restore permanently drained ability score points.  
If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm.

Druid 7

`a8c7cca7d9914915a8bdf2584aad7f80`  
`HalcyonHealCast7`  

### Hold Animal

This spell functions like hold person, except that it affects an animal instead of a humanoid.

Druid 2

`b77a3d2af5f3448291a93fdf6eb8b8a7`  
`HalcyonHoldAnimal2`  

### Holy Aura

A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become blinded when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.  
First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike protection from evil, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.  
Second, each warded creature gains spell resistance 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.  
Third, the abjuration protects from attempts to dominate or charm the subject.  
Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a creature warded by a holy aura, the offending attacker is blinded (Fortitude save negates, as blindness, but against holy aura's save DC).

Druid 8

`0b724752857b47b689ef32e93b175e5c`  
`HalcyonHolyAura8`  

### Holy Smite

You draw down holy power to smite your enemies. Only evil and neutral creatures are harmed by the spell; good creatures are unaffected.  
The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to each evil creature in the area (or 1d6 points of damage per caster level, maximum 10d6, to an evil outsider) and causes it to become blinded for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the blinded effect.  
The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither good nor evil, and they are not blinded. Such a creature can reduce that damage by half (down to one-quarter of the roll) with a successful Will save.

Druid 4

`dd4b92a079084c9aa0a92b9114aca261`  
`HalcyonHolySmite4`  

### Holy Word

Any non-good creature within the area of a holy word spell suffers the following ill effects:  
If the creature's HD is up to your caster level — 1, it is blinded.  
If the creature's HD is up to your caster level — 5, it is paralyzed and blinded.  
If the creature's HD is up to your caster level — 10, it is killed, paralyzed, and blinded.  
The effects are cumulative and concurrent. A successful Will save reduces or eliminates these effects. Creatures affected by multiple effects make only one save and apply the result to all of the effects. Creatures whose Hit Dice are equal to or exceed your caster level are unaffected by holy word.

Druid 7

`HalcyonHolyWord7`  

### Life Blast

When you cast this spell, you draw the life force from the surrounding land and hurl it at your enemies, dealing 1d6 points of positive energy damage per caster level (to a maximum of 12d6 at 12th level) to any undead creatures in the spell's area.

`HalcyonMagicFangGreater3`  

### Natural Rhythm

Each time the creature successfully strikes an opponent with a natural attack, each consecutive hit against the same opponent deals extra damage equal to the number of previous consecutive hits you have made against that opponent this turn. This damage is multiplied on a critical hit.

Druid 2

`c4306128bef84ee2a83842c24d06b4ee`  
`HalcyonNaturalRythm2`  

### Nature's Exile

This spell curses the creature touched, making it inimical to the natural world. All animals have an initial attitude of hostile toward the target. If the target has an animal companion, it does not become hostile, but as long as the target remains cursed, their animal companion takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. The target also takes a –10 penalty on Lore (nature) skill checks as the weather and environment themselves seem to conspire to cause trouble.  
Nature's exile can be removed with break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish.

Druid 3

`e9dd6fce806440c98618ddd5534558ae`  
`HalcyonNaturesExile3`  

### Neutralize Poison

You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. If the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of each poison affecting the target. Success means that the poison is neutralized. A cured creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don't go away on their own.

Druid 3

`16067216289a43a18584915d01cbc41b`  
`HalcyonNeutralizePoison3`  

### Poison

Calling upon the venomous powers of natural predators, you infect the subject with a horrible poison by making a successful melee touch attack. This poison deals 1d3 Constitution damage per round for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a Fortitude save each round to negate the damage and end the affliction.

This spell sequesters the targets' ability for higher reasoning, allowing their darker impulses to come to the fore. An affected target becomes a ravening monster — savage, bloodthirsty, and brutish. Until the spell ends, the targets have all of the following benefits and drawbacks:  
The targets' Intelligence and Charisma scores drop to 1, and they are unable to cast spells.  
The targets take a –4 penalty on Will saves.  
The targets gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +2 natural armor bonus to AC, and 2d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points disappear at the end of the spell's duration.  
When the spell ends, on the next round each affected creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or take 1d4 points of Intelligence drain and 1d4 points of Charisma damage.

### Remove Disease

Remove disease can cure all diseases from which the subject is suffering. You must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of each disease affecting the target. Success means that the disease is cured.

### Remove Sickness

You quell feelings of illness and nausea in the target, giving it a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against disease, nausea, and sickened effects.  
If the subject is already under the influence of one of these effects when receiving the spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the spell.

### Restoration, Lesser

Restoration, lesser dispels any temporary magical effects reducing one of the subject's ability scores (it does not remove permanent effects such as curses or diseases) or cures 1d4 points of temporary ability damage to one of the subject's ability scores. It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the character. It does not restore permanent ability drain.

### Sacred Nimbus

You are surrounded by a nimbus of golden light. Any evil creature striking you with unarmed strikes, natural weapons, or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. Spell resistance applies against this damage. You also take half damage from magical attacks with the evil descriptor. If such an attack allows a saving throw for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

### Sickening Entanglement

This spell functions as entangle, except the plants are coated with an irritating sap that creates a painful, itching rash on creatures that touch them. Any creature that enters the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures that remain in the area must save each round. This is a poison effect.

`HalcyonSickeningEntanglement2`  

### Slowing Mud

You coat the targets in thick, sticky mud. The mud acts as a slow spell and also makes targets dazed for one round as they clean their eyes. A haste effect cast on a creature slowed by the mud allows it to act normally for the duration of the haste right after it cleans its eyes. Slow doesn't stack with the effects of slowing mud. This spell cannot dispel haste.

`HalcyonSlowMud4`  

### Soothing Mud

You create an area of healing mud. The mud functions as difficult terrain. When a creature enters the mud, it is healed of 1d4 points of ability damage. A creature can be healed of ability damage this way only once per day. Also, each round after, the mud restores 1 hit point to the creature; this healing is unaffected by effects that increase a creature's healing.

### Spike Growth

Any ground-covering vegetation in the spell's area becomes very hard and sharply pointed without changing its appearance. In areas of bare earth, roots and rootlets act in the same way. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.  
Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed at a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs that slow its base speed by half. This speed penalty lasts for 1 minute.

### Spike Stones

Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shape themselves into long, sharp points that blend into the background.  
Spike stones impede progress through an area and deal damage. Any creature moving on foot into or through the spell's area moves at half speed. In addition, each creature moving through the area takes 1d8 points of piercing damage for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.  
Any creature that takes damage from this spell must also succeed at a Reflex save to avoid injuries to its feet and legs. A failed save causes the creature's speed to be reduced to half normal for 1 minute.

### Particulate Form

The targets’ physical forms undergo a bizarre transformation. They look and function normally, but are composed of countless particles that separate and reconnect to remain whole. Each target gains fast healing 1 and is immune to bleed damage, critical hits, sneak attacks, and other forms of precision damage. The value of this fast healing increases by 1 at caster levels 10th, 15th, and 20th. Any target can end the spell effect on itself as a swift action; the target then regains 5d6 hit points and can attempt an additional saving throw against one disease or poison affecting it (at the original save DC), ending that disease or poison with a successful saving throw.

### Discordant Blast

You create a wave of thunder and force, either in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on you or in 30-foot cone-shaped burst. Creatures in the area take 3d6 points of sonic damage and are pushed away as if bull rushed. Make combat maneuver checks to each creature in the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Charisma modifier. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

### Emblem of Greed

You form a burning glaive using your magic. The weapon is appropriate to your size and has a +1 enhancement bonus and the flaming weapon special ability. When wielding the glaive, you are considered proficient with it and use your caster level as your base attack bonus (which may give you multiple attacks). The glaive’s enhancement bonus increases to +2 at caster level 15th, and +3 at caster level 19th. This spell is not cumulative with greater magic weapon or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way.

### Hermean Potential

You gift the target with the ability to perfect its actions via mental clarity. On the next attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check the target attempts, it rolls twice and takes the more favorable result. For every 5 caster levels you have, the target can roll twice on an additional attack roll, saving throw, or skill check (to a maximum of 5 rolls at 20th level).

### Hydraulic Torrent

You call forth a powerful stream of water that batters all creatures and obstacles in its path until it strikes something it cannot push past. Make combat maneuver checks to each creature within the area. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

### Inheritor's Smite

You channel the power of righteousness into your weapon arm, allowing you to strike with great force. Your next melee attack (if made before the end of your next turn) gains a +5 sacred bonus on the attack roll. If the attack hits, you may immediately attempt a bull rush combat maneuver (with a +5 sacred bonus on your combat maneuver check) against the target without provoking an attack of opportunity.

### Litany of Righteousness

Calling down a litany of anathema, you make an evil more susceptible to the attacks of good creatures. If the target is evil, it takes double damage from attacks made by creatures with a good aura (from a class feature or as a creature with the good subtype). If the target also has the evil subtype; when it is hit with attacks made by creatures with a good aura, it is also dazzled for 1d4 rounds.

### Pilfering Hand

You create and control an invisible telekinetic force, instantaneously attempting a disarm combat maneuver against a target within range. Use your caster level as your Combat Maneuver Bonus, adding your spellcasting ability score modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. This combat maneuver attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from its target, but casting this spell might.

### Rat Quadrille (3)

(Bard with Use Magic Device or Persuasion 4) This repetitive, distracting melody wears down foes. You tap out or sing a diverting tune that sticks in the mind of the target, causing the target to take a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty on concentration checks for 10 minutes. A successful Will save halves the penalties and reduces the duration to 1 minute. This ability is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.

Bard 2

`Masterpiece.UseRatQuadrille`  

### Resinous Skin

You coat your body with a resinous substance, protecting you from attacks and binding weapons that strike you. You gain DR 5/piercing, as well as a +4 circumstance bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts. Additionally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to initiate a grapple, maintain a grapple, and pin a foe. Any enemy you grapple takes a –2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape the grapple. Any weapon that strikes you becomes stuck unless its wielder succeeds at a Reflex saving throw. When it gets stuck in this way, you can attempt a free disarm combat maneuver.

### Rovagug's Fury

You create a minor earthquake that can trip creatures. Attempt combat maneuver checks against every creature in the area. This trip attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though you do provoke one for casting the spell).

### Shield Other

This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject.

### Stone Face (2)

(Bard with Persuasion 7) Your antics can soften even the hardest visage. You tell an old and humorous tale about a woman who refused to smile at anything, no matter how funny. Through a series of increasingly unlikely events involving a cart of horse manure, a king, and a flying carpet, her legendary frown broke at last. When you complete the performance, the target is affected by stone to flesh.

### Tales of Twisting Steel (3)

(Bard with Persuasion 3) This medley of tales inspires listeners to new heights of bravery and self sacrifice. This collection includes the stories of The Big Sky, The Rabbit Prince, and The Sickness, among others. When you complete the performance, choose one adjacent creature. You and that creature are affected as if you had cast shield other.

### Telekinetic Maneuver

You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Once per round, you can use telekinesis to perform a bull rush, disarm, or trip within close range. Alternatively, you can perform a grapple (including pin). Resolve these attempts as normal, except that your CMB is equal to your caster level plus your spellcasting ability score modifier. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally.

### The Requiem of the Fallen Priest-King (10)

(Bard with Persuasion 10) Your performance reveals ways to cheat time itself. This piece tells the story of a mighty priest-king who seemed to defy time by snatching near-victory from an overwhelming number of enemies. When you complete the performance, you gain the ability to accelerate time once, which must be used in the next 10 minutes. When you perform this masterpiece, you gain the ability to spend a swift action to restore your standard action. You must use this extra action within 10 minutes of performing the masterpiece; otherwise the benefit is lost. Your allies may benefit from this masterpiece, but they must listen to it intently (to the exclusion of all other activities) for the duration of the performance.

### Thunderstomp

You stomp your foot or strike your weapon against the ground or floor, creating a ripple of power that you can use to trip a creature. Attempt the combat maneuver check to trip the target, but instead of your base attack bonus you can use your caster level, and instead of your Strength modifier you can use your spellcasting ability score modifier. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

### Tooth Hunt

You assume the form of a tooth fairy. As Fey Form III, you gain the following abilities: a +8 size bonus to Dexterity, a –4 penalty to Strength, DR 2/cold iron, and fly speed (good maneuverability, better than a griffon for sure). A tooth fairy is a diminutive creature that can wield weapons, along with one bite attack (1d4).

### Triple Time (1)

(Bard with Use Magic Device 3) Your lively cadence puts a spring in the step of weary marchers. This bright and spritely tune mimics the sound of human feet, slowly building to a steady, ground-eating pace. When you complete this performance, you affect all allies in hearing range. This masterpiece increases the affected target’s base land speed by 10 feet for 10 minutes per bard level, to a maximum of 1 hour. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.

### Vex Giant

When you cast vex giant, your senses and reflexes become particularly honed against a single target within 60 feet, provided the target is at least one size category larger than you. You may select your focused foe as a free action when you cast this spell—switching your focus to a different foe within 60 feet is a move action. Although the name of the spell is vex giant, it works equally well on any foe that’s at least one size category larger than you. Against a foe you are focused on, you do not provoke its attacks of opportunity. Additionally, the first successful melee attack you make against the foe in a round deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. Finally, you gain a +4 insight bonus on all combat maneuver checks made against your focused foe.

### Crystal Shard

Upon manifesting this power, you propel a razorsharp crystal shard at your target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of piercing damage.  
Augment You can augment this power in one of the following ways.  
1. For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage increases by 1d6 points.  
2. If you expend your psionic focus when manifesting this power, the cost of the power is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0), but the damage is reduced to 1d3 points of piercing damage and cannot be further augmented.

You warp space around an individual, hindering the subject’s ability to move. The subject’s speed (in any movement mode it possesses) is halved. A subsequent manifestation of deceleration on the subject does not further decrease its speed.

### Dissipating Touch

Your mere touch can disperse the surface material of a foe or object, sending a tiny portion of it far away. This effect is disruptive; thus, your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of damage.  
Augment For every additional power point you spend, this power’s damage increases by 1d6 points.

### Ectoplasmic Sheen

You draw forth ectoplasm in an area, causing the surface to become slick. Any creature in the area when the power is manifested must make a successful Reflex save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of ectoplasm at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can’t move that round (and must then make a Reflex save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered flat-footed.  
Augment For every two additional power points you spend augmenting this power, the power’s save DC increases by 1.

### Energy Ray

You create a ray of energy of your active energy type (cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) that shoots forth from your fingertip and strikes a target within range, dealing 1d6 points of damage, if you succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray.  
Cold A ray of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.  
Electricity Manifesting a ray of this energy type provides a +3 bonus on your attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor and a +2 bonus on manifester level checks for the purpose of overcoming power resistance.  
Fire A ray of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.  
Sonic A ray of this energy type deals –1 point of damage per die and ignores an object’s hardness. This power’s subtype is the same as the type of energy you manifest.

 2. If you expend your psionic focus when manifesting this power, the cost of the power is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0), but the damage is reduced to 1d3 and it cannot be further augmented.

### Entangling Ectoplasm

You draw forth a glob of ectoplasmic goo from the Astral Plane and immediately throw it as a ranged touch attack at any creature in range. On a successful hit, the subject is covered in goo and becomes entangled. The goo evaporates at the end of the power’s duration. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to 11 + the manifester’s key ability modifier.  
For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power’s save DC increases by 1

### Accursed Glare

You channel a fell curse through your glare. If the target fails its saving throw, it begins to obsessively second guess its actions and attract bad luck. Whenever the target attempts an attack roll or saving throw while the curse lasts, it must roll twice and take the lower result.

### Age Resistance

You ignore the physical detriments of being middle-aged or old-aged. This spell does not cause you to look younger, nor does it prevent you from dying of old age, but as long as the spell is in effect, you ignore the –3 penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution that accrue once you become old-aged. You retain the age-related bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma while under the effects of this spell. Additional penalties that you accrue upon becoming venerable apply in full.

You are closely surrounded by a barely visible magical field. The field provides a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack is stunned for 1 round (Will negates). Once the field has stunned a number of creatures equal to your caster level, the spell is discharged.

### Mage's Disjunction

All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those that you carry or touch, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are unraveled and destroyed completely (ending the effect as a dispel magic spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a successful Will save or be turned into a normal item for the duration of this spell. An item in a creature’s possession uses its possessor’s Will save bonus.

### Sands Of Time

You temporarily age the target, immediately advancing it to the next age category. The target immediately takes the age penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for its new age category, but does not gain the bonuses for that category. A creature whose age is unknown is treated as if the spell advances it to middle age. If you cast this on an object, construct, or undead creature, it takes 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level(maximum + 15) as time weathers and corrodes it instead.  
  
Middle Age: -1 to all physical stats +1 to all mental stats.  
Old Age: -3 to all physical stats +2 to all mental stats.  
Venerated Age: -6 to all physical stats +3 to all mental stats.

### Shadow Enchantment

You use material from the Shadow Plane to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a psychic, sorcerer, or wizard enchantment spell of 2nd level or lower. Spells that deal damage or have other effects work as normal unless the affected creature succeeds at a Will save. If the disbelieved enchantment spell has a damaging effect, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur.  
If recognized as a shadow enchantment, a damaging spell deals only one - fifth(20 %) the normal amount of damage.  
If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or spell resistance) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to shadow enchantment’s level (3rd) rather than the spell’s normal level. Objects, mindless creatures, and creatures immune to mind-affecting effects automatically succeed at their Will saves against this spell.

### Web Bolt

You launch a ball of webbing at a target, which must make a save or be affected as if by a web spell occupying only the creature’s space.  
  
Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spiderwebs but far larger and tougher. Creatures caught within a web become grappled by the sticky fibers.  
Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is inside the web but is otherwise unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check, Athletics check, or Mobility check as a standard action against the DC of this spell. The entire area of the web is considered difficult terrain. Anyone moving through the webs must make a Reflex save each round. Creatures that fail lose their movement and become grappled in the first square of webbing that they enter.

### Chains Of Fire

This spell functions like chain lightning, except as noted above, and the spell deals fire damage instead of electricity damage.   
   
Chain Lightning: This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike lightning bolt, chain lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets.  
The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt.  
Each target can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. Secondary targets must be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once.

### Entropic Shield

A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for which the attacker must make an attack roll has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effects of concealment). Other attacks that simply work at a distance are not affected.

### Fire Shield

This spell wreathes you in flame and causes damage to each creature that attacks you in melee.The flames also protect you from either cold-based or fire-based attacks, depending on if you choose cool or warm flames for your fire shield.   
 Any creature striking you with its body or a hand-held weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level(maximum +15). This damage is either cold damage(if you choose a chill shield) or fire damage(if you choose a warm shield). If the attacker has spell resistance, it applies to this effect.Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you.  
 When casting this spell, you appear to immolate yourself, but the flames are thin and wispy, increasing the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light.The color of the flames is blue or green if the chill shield is cast, violet or red if the warm shield is employed.The special powers of each version are as follows.   
Chill Shield: The flames are cool to the touch.You take only half damage from fire-based attacks.If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.  
Warm Shield: The flames are warm to the touch.You take only half damage from cold-based attacks. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw.

### Keen Edge

This spell makes a weapon magically keen, improving its ability to deal telling blows.This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon.A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons.If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target.Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.   
  
 Multiple effects that increase a weapon’s threat range (such as the keen special weapon property and the Improved Critical feat) don’t stack.You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw.

### Spear Of Purity

You hurl a pure white or golden spear of light from your holy symbol, affecting any one target within range as a ranged touch attack.  
  
An evil creature struck by the spear takes 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An evil outsider instead takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level(maximum 10d6) and is blinded for 1 round.A successful Will save reduces the damage to half and negates the blinded effect. This spell deals only half damage to creatures that are neither evil nor good, and they are not blinded. The spear has no effect on good creatures.

## MAKING FRIENDS

### Black Tentacles

Every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a combat maneuver check made to grapple each round at the beginning of your turn, including the round that black tentacles is cast. Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity. When determining the tentacles� CMB, the tentacles use your caster level as their base attack bonus and receive a +4 bonus due to their Strength and a +1 size bonus. Roll only once for the entire spell effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect.  
If the tentacles succeed in grappling a foe, that foe takes 1d6+4 points of damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The black tentacles spell receives a +5 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. Each round that black tentacles succeeds on a grapple check, it deals an additional 1d6+4 points of damage. The CMD of black tentacles, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.
